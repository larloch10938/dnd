The body of government that advices the King is the The Diaconi (the deacons), which is also the name of the original group of adventurers who colonized the green belt and founded Allania.

The current seats are:
Main Cities and Towns
Allania
Allania, the great and prosperous capital city, is divided into three major districts: Old Allania, Middtown, and The Shacks.
1. Old Allania: This is the oldest part of the city, founded in 1372 by the first deacons. Colloquially known as the "first court," it is surrounded by old walls facing the rest of the city this district, which hosts a large and well-stocked market catering to the daily needs of the wealthy families residing in the district.
2. Middtown: Considered the beating heart of the city, Middtown is divided into several sub-districts, each with a more or less defined function beyond being residential.
The southern part is primarily residential, housing the vast majority of Allania's citizens in buildings made of wood and lime, or sometimes stone. While mainly residential, it has a scattering of small food shops and humble temples. Closer to the walls, buildings are almost entirely made of stone and house what is commonly called the city's "dwarven ghetto."
Commercial District: This is the true core of the city. Its streets host various government buildings, such as the Town Hall and the Guild Palace. Overlooking the river is a small fortress, one of the branches of the Bank of Gulnak, protected by the vigilant Order of the Hammer. This central area also contains various workshops, blacksmiths, and jewelesses guarded by various armed mercenary companies in the guilds' employ. For the more adventurous, this area also offers various taverns of dubious reputation. It is said that for those seeking thrills without taking too many risks, unlike in The Shacks, this district is suitable, being rich in gambling and prostitution for all social classes.
3. The Shacks: Generally defined as the neighborhoods located outside the city walls, where the authority of the city guards is diminished. Governed by small local gangs, these are areas that a respectable citizen only traverses on the main road when entering or leaving the city. Plagued by misery and poverty, they house those who cannot afford a home within the walls in dilapidated shacks. They also host what is commonly called The Bazaar, an itinerant clandestine market open only for a few hours before dusk, where it is said one can find the most varied goods, especially those considered illegal within the city.
Clear Town: A picturesque area known for housing the cizing the scarcity of surface resources underground, Gul Nak's leaders are investing heavily in agriculture. This initiative addresses a long-standing limitation on subterranean growth, a problem RokTod Durgak of Citadel Drurnak sought to solve by bypassing the costly Great Crevasse trade route. Gul Nak's location, surrounded by fertile fields, makes it an ideal source for grains and livestock sought by deep-dwelling dwarves. The Marca's taxation of this trade has been readily accepted by the orderly dwarves, significantly benefiting the region. This flourishing commerce has even softened traditional dwarven rigidity, evidenced in the Citadel's evolving architecture.
Bes Inix
The name of the city means the resurrected. It was originally founded by one of the original Diaconi, El Dayan, a priest of Kossuth which eventually become the first spiritual leader of the kingdom (which was just a Duchy at the time).
Bes Inix has very good iron and gold mines close to the city, hence it has always been the main forge cilowly being drained. It’s home to more than 5000 citizen. The Lord is Lady Kisandra Numesti.
Wym
A collection of farms and small villages distributed in the plains south of Drelev. The lord is Baron Okerra. The best horses of the kingdom come from here.
Torrerossa
Originally founded as clay pit. Given its slightly higher position in the plains surrounding Alliania it was quickly recognized as a great place to build a watchtower. From this the name, Torrerossa, which means Red Tower. The red is from argyl minerals. It is now a small but well developed town. It benefits from the close distance to Allania. It is the gateway to the Shaar plains in the South. It is the main rally point for the armies of the kingdom, being close to the capital, well supplied and with plenty of space. It is governed by the Baron Boris Manobianca.
Izra
A cursed city, the place where the followers of Seltyel regrouped. It’s also the place where Guglielmo Edelroth, The Eternal Guardian, died defending the artifact know as the Hand  the continuation of his lineage with an heir, takes a wife from the March of Drelev, one of the daughters saved during the assault, and has two children.
The years pass quickly, in peace and the political intrigues of the merchant companies that have increasing power in the duchy (now they are a stable part of the council and their voice carries weight, even institutionally). Lohe, after 15 years of peace, often stops, lost in thought, in the council hall and looks at his tower shield hanging with the longsword behind it, which helped build the peace of today: there is nostalgia in his gaze. Today his weapons are pen and ink.
All that remains is to resist and continue to fight with new weapons for the good of the duchy for about ten years, when finally one of his heirs will be able to take over the kingdom. But in the end, having come from humble origins, without a goal and lost among too many possibilities and without an identity, he managed to forge himself along the way through various adventures and becoormer pirate of the Southern Seas, he abandoned the outlaw life not out of repentance, but for a higher ambition, rebuilding himself as a man of law, a political strategist, and an architect of order. He was among the founders of the capital, Allania, a commander in the defeat of the Stag Lord, a key player in the defense of the city during the Long Night, and a leading force in the suppression of the El Dayan heresy, and today he governs the beating heart of the kingdom’s power with an iron fist and a razor-sharp mind. He is the founder of the most powerful trade company in the realm, the pragmatic soul behind the Keepers of the Light, the mastermind of the Bravi of Allania, and the former Grandmaster of the Order of the Skulls of Varnhold—now dissolved, though still whispered of in the underworld as a symbol of brutal strength and blind loyalty. 

Now, in his sixties, Ser Roberts is heavy in body but not in spirit: his corpulent frame, wrapped in fine but never frivolous garments, moves with measured sl, but not in justice; in loyalty, but only when earned; in religion, but only as a tool to control fanatics. He trusts no one who has not risked their life at least once for something greater than themselves. His ducal crest, displayed throughout the eastern territories, depicts a horn on a green field beside a white skull on blood red—a clear memory of his violent origins and the price paid for every alliance forged. In the halls of power, his slow footsteps echo like a warning, and when he speaks, even the proudest nobles fall silent. He is the shadow behind the crown, the thread that binds factions, the only one who can broker deals between dwarves and humans, clerics and merchants, soldiers and criminals. 

He is not a hero, nor does he consider himself one. He is a survivor, a builder—and, when needed, a destroyer. Because in a young and fragile kingdom like Chasir-Asak, sometimes a king is not enough: it takes a ruthless bastard who knows how to hold it all together when ideals fail. And that bastard his military prowess and administrative duties, Ser Dastan is renowned throughout the Border Kingdoms as a jousting champion. His dominance in Allania's jousting tournaments is undisputed, and he stands among the greatest champions in the wider Border Kingdoms. His fame extends to Emrys, where he has faced formidable opponents such as Yarelan Surtova and famously contended with his historical nemesis, the now-deceased Black Duke. In Blacksaddle, his competitive spirit has brought him against Lord David Ragrael, Captain of the Blades, and even the King himself, Thalon Blacksaddle, a competitor universally known for his less-than-honorable tactics on the jousting field.
El Dayan
He was the first head of the church. His faith was for Kossuth, the god of fire. He was part of the original group of the Diaconi. While very powerful he was also very ambitious and eventually clashed with the rest of the group. He was the original lord of Bes Inix, but his heresy got him killed. The faith of Kossuth is now banned in mbition deserves reward: the path to power is the rightful prize of the worthy, though it inevitably comes with hardship and suffering. Kossuth sends his sacred fire to purify and temper the souls of his followers. Face life's trials with resolve, as they test and shape your worth. Those who stand above you have earned their position and deserve your service. Lead others toward the pure flame of Kossuth, so that all life may be returned to its essential state.

Fyrin l’Oscuro

Filie
The old chancellor, now dead. He was a strong supporter of Helm and the main religious authority

Seltyel

Stepsay, once known as Seltyiel Kalai, is a 34-year-old half-elf who transformed his life from that of a quarrelsome wanderer into a paladin of the Sacred Light. Once immersed in excess and tavern brawls, his path changed dramatically after encountering a sacred tome and receiving a vision from the god Helm, who set him on the road to redemption. Spiritually reborn, he took the name Stepsay and devoted himself to the relenter’s tales of the mythical Silver Lake and rejected her father’s passive life. Determined to restore her clan’s lost glory, she journeyed to the legendary lake to undertake the Trial of the Thirteen Spirits. During the spiritual ritual, she had a vivid vision of a brutal orc raid on a fishing village. Initially filled with fury, she was ready to unleash elemental destruction. But upon seeing a wounded child, her anger turned to compassion. Choosing mercy over violence, she shielded the child by transforming into a tree-like form, merging with the coastal forest. This act of selflessness earned her the blessing of the Spirit of Life, who granted her its powers. When she awoke, her body was marked with glowing green patterns — symbols of her bond with the Spirit. With newfound strength, Andras set off toward her destiny, ready to face the challenges ahead.

Geography
The Border Kingdoms represent a second wave of human colonization in a frontier region. This land lies at the edge of the vast Shaar grasslands and serves as a meeting points made up of three large lakes from which several navigable rivers originate, used as the main trade routes. Lake Fang is the primary commercial basin, while Hooktongue Lake is the only one not connected to the rest of the duchy.

Emrys
Emrys is a large fortified city in the Border Kingdoms, sometimes called "the Throat of Val Talduth." It sits along the Herding Road, which connects the Border Kingdoms to the edges of the Shaar, making it a key transit point for travelers coming from the Duchy of Allania.

The city is built on a hill at the southern end of the cold Subterranean Lake Emrysar. During the rainy season, the underground waters form a navigable network that allows goods to be transported all the way to the shores of the Shimmering Sea. Emrys stretches just over 2.5 km in length and about half that in width, defended by concentric walls and crowned by the keep of Emrystarl.

The city is characterized by cobbled streets, tall narrow buildings with steep roofs, and "Candle Workshops" in the basementslack Bart, named after the original name of Ser Roberts when he was still a pirate. Today most people are not too sure of the origin, but keep drinking it.

Akiros Ismort was originally a follower of the Stag Lord.

The most important artifacts of Allania are three sacred objects:
The Shield of Lohe
The Hand of Filie
The Hammer of Durgak
