### SECTION THREE: THE FEAST OF THE NEW KING

#### SCENE A: THE POLITICAL CHESSBOARD

**SETTING:** A richly decorated room adjacent to the main feasting hall. The sounds of celebration – music, laughter, and the clatter of plates – can be heard faintly in the background. A large table is present, though only a few of the main characters are seated. The rest are standing, glasses of wine in hand.

KING LOHE is seated, looking paler and more fatigued than ever, though he attempts to maintain a regal posture. LORD ROBERTS stands beside him, a protective and imposing figure. SER DASTAN is near Roberts, his expression sharp and observant. DUCHESS ANDRAS is pacing nervously, while GENERAL TOK-NAK stands like a statue, his hand never far from his warhammer. HIGH PRIEST BORIS is also present, a smug satisfaction in his eyes.

**KING LOHE**
(His voice is a low rasp, but he forces a smile)
A successful day, my lords, my lady. The kingdom is… secure.

**BORIS**
(With a pious nod)
Helm has blessed us, Your Majesty. The people rejoice.

**ROBERTS**
(Cutting to the chase)
They rejoice for now. But the old problems remain. We must address them before they fester. Let’s start with the most pressing: the Edelroth claim on Izra. The city is a cursed place, but it is also a strategic asset. Andrisha holds it now, but the Edelroths have a strong claim by blood.

**TOK-NAK**
(Grumbling)
Guglielmo Edelroth is a stubborn old goat, but his family has held land in the west for generations. His son, Aethan, is young and untested, but the claim is strong. A trial by combat, as they have requested, would be... decisive.

**ANDRAS**
(Stopping her pacing)
Decisive? It would be barbaric. Aethan is a boy. Andrisha is a skilled warrior, but she should not have to defend her title with blood. It is not the way of a just kingdom.

**KING LOHE**
(Waving a dismissive hand, a gesture that costs him some effort)
Andrisha is a loyal servant of the crown. I will not see her cast aside. But the Edelroths are powerful. We cannot afford to make them our enemies. What are the options?

**ROBERTS**
As I see it, we have three paths, each with its own poison.

(He holds up a finger)
One: we grant the trial by combat. It is the ancient way, and it would satisfy the Edelroths' honor. But it is a savage solution, and we risk losing a valuable ally in Andrisha, or making a martyr of a young boy.

(He holds up a second finger)
Two: we deny the trial and simply give the barony to the Edelroths. This would appease them and secure their loyalty. But it would leave Andrisha landless and dishonored, a dangerous thing to do to a woman of her standing and popularity.

(He holds up a third finger)
Three: we refuse their claim outright. This would keep Andrisha in power, but it would turn the Edelroths against us. They would become a festering wound in the west, a constant source of rebellion and dissent.

**BORIS**
(His eyes gleaming)
There is a fourth path. The Church can mediate. We can examine the ancient laws, the precedents, the bloodlines. It would be a long and... complex process. But it would avoid bloodshed and ensure that the final decision is... just.

**DASTAN**
(His voice is low and steady)
And it would give the Church a great deal of power and influence in the west. A permanent foothold in a region where it has little.

**KING LOHE**
(He looks around the table at his council, his eyes lingering on each of them. He seems to be weighing their words, their ambitions, their loyalties. He then turns to the empty space at the table, where the players would be.)

We are at a crossroads. Each path is fraught with peril. What is your counsel? What is the wise and just path for the kingdom?

What is your counsel? What is the wise and just path for the kingdom?

**KING LOHE**
(He gestures to ROBERTS to continue, the effort of the last speech leaving him breathless.)

**ROBERTS**
(His voice low and steady, a counterpoint to the king's weakness)
And what of the East? The regency of Varnhold cannot continue indefinitely. Lorentius has come of age. The law is clear.

**ANDRAS**
The law is clear, but the boy is not. He is weak, easily led, and has a taste for cheap wine and expensive pleasures. To give him the East would be to condemn its people to misrule and exploitation.

**TOK-NAK**
Andrisha has ruled the East well. The people are prosperous, the borders are secure. To remove her would be to invite chaos.

**ROBERTS**
To keep her as regent would be to defy the law. The other nobles would see it as a sign of tyranny, a king who places his own will above the ancient rights of inheritance. They would whisper, they would plot, they would rebel.

**BORIS**
The law must be upheld. It is the foundation of a stable kingdom. To break it, even for the best of reasons, is to invite the very chaos you seek to avoid.

**ROBERTS**
(His voice drops even lower, and he leans in, his eyes cold and hard)
There is another option. A darker path. Lorentius is... careless. He rides too fast, he drinks too much, he keeps company with dangerous men. An accident... a fall from a horse, a tavern brawl that goes too far... such things happen.

**DASTAN**
(His face is unreadable, but his voice is sharp)
A convenient accident. It would solve the problem, certainly. But it would be a stain on the king's soul, a secret that could be used against him.

**KING LOHE**
(He looks at the council, his face a mask of pain. He then turns to the players, his eyes pleading.)

Another choice, another poisoned cup. Do we uphold the law and risk the East? Do we break the law and risk the kingdom? Or do we... remove the problem, and risk our own souls? What is your counsel?

**ROBERTS**
(He straightens up, his expression grim)
And finally, the south. Baron Okerra is old, and his daughter, a religious zealot, wishes to give her entire inheritance—the lands, the castle, the famous stables—to the Order of Helm.

**BORIS**
A noble and pious gesture. The Order of Helm is a force for good in the world. Their presence on our southern border would be a powerful deterrent to our enemies.

**TOK-NAK**
(Snorting)
A powerful deterrent to our own authority is more like it. The Order answers to no king. They would be a kingdom within our kingdom, a cancer that would spread.

**ANDRAS**
The girl is young. She is being manipulated by the Order. We cannot allow her to make such a mistake, for her own sake as well as the kingdom's.

**ROBERTS**
We have a few options. We can simply allow it. Let the Order have the land. It would be the path of least resistance, but it would set a dangerous precedent and create a powerful new faction in the south.

**YHULIA**
We could declare that no noble house can give its lands to another power, religious or otherwise. A new law, a bold statement. It would solve the immediate problem, but it would anger the pious and could be seen as an attack on the rights of the nobility.

**ROBERTS**
Or... we could try to persuade the Baron. A... guiding hand could convince him to nominate a new heir, someone more... amenable to the crown's interests. It would be a delicate game, but it would solve the problem without bloodshed or new laws.

**BORIS**
(Hardly able to contain his anger)
A guiding hand? You mean manipulation. You would ask a father to betray his daughter's wishes, to turn her zealotry into a tool for your own ends? That is not the way of Helm.

**KING LOHE**
(He sighs, the weight of the world on his shoulders. He looks to the players.)

So many choices, so many dangers. Do we allow a foreign power to take root in our kingdom? Do we challenge the rights of our nobles? Or do we manipulate a grieving girl for our own ends? What is your counsel? What is the path of wisdom?

**(A royal attendant enters and bows deeply.)**

**ATTENDANT**
Your Majesty, the ambassadors are growing restless. They are eager to present their gifts.

**KING LOHE**
(Taking a deep breath and pushing himself to his feet)
Very well. Let us not keep them waiting.

**(He sways slightly, and DASTAN, who has been standing silently in the corner, is instantly at his side, offering a steadying arm.)**

**DASTAN**
Your Majesty.

**KING LOHE**
(With a grateful nod)
Thank you, Captain. Let us go and see what treasures our friends have brought us.

**(The group exits the solar and moves towards the main hall, the sounds of the feast growing louder.)**

#### SCENE B: THE FEAST AND THE GIFTS

**SETTING:** The Great Hall of the Ducal Palace, now a royal court. The room is a riot of color and sound. Banners of the newly proclaimed kingdom hang from the rafters. The tables are laden with food, and wine flows freely. A large fireplace roars at one end of the hall. At the center of the room, a whole roasted boar, stuffed with herbs and apples, is being carved.

KING LOHE is seated at the high table, with his council and the most important nobles. The ambassadors from the neighboring kingdoms are seated at a place of honor. The rest of the hall is filled with lesser nobles, knights, and wealthy merchants.

**(A portly woman with a beaming smile and flushed cheeks, GERTRUDE, the head cook, approaches the high table. She is followed by two kitchen hands carrying a massive silver platter, on which rests a magnificent roasted peacock, its feathers reattached to create a stunning display.)**

**GERTRUDE**
(Curtsying deeply, her voice full of pride)
Your Majesty, my humble gift to you and the kingdom. The Peacock of a Hundred Eyes, roasted with spices from the south and stuffed with a puree of chestnuts and truffles. May your reign be as rich and flavorful as this dish.

**KING LOHE**
(Managing a weak smile)
Gertrude, you have outdone yourself. It is a work of art. My thanks.

**(Gertrude beams and curtsies again before retreating. As the peacock is served, AURIEL L'AULICO bangs his staff on the floor.)**

**AURIEL L'AULICO**
Let us have a moment of culture to aid our digestion! I present to you the young bard, Sigismondo, who will recite a poem of his own composition, "The Life of Lohe."

**(A young man with intense eyes and a nervous energy steps forward. He carries a single scroll. He bows to the king, unrolls the scroll, and begins to read. His voice is clear and strong, and it rings with emotion.)**

**SIGISMONDO**
From humble roots, a hero takes the field,
In wild green lands, his destiny revealed.
With faithful friends, a fellowship of might,
He carved a home and brought it to the light.

He faced the Stag Lord, crowned with branch and bone,
And on that hill, he claimed it for his own.
From that first victory, a city grew,
Allania rising, prosperous and new.

Then came the darkness, monstrous and vast,
A feathered beast, a shadow from the past.
The owlbear struck, with fury and with dread,
And Lohe fell, the Shield of Allania, dead.

But fate decreed his story was not done,
A second chance, a life anew begun.
He rose again, to lead and to command,
And build a nation, strong of heart and hand.

From Marquis first, to Duke of Ruby bright,
He raised his banner, a beacon in the night.
And now a King, upon a throne of state,
To guide his people and to seal their fate.

**(The poem ends, and the hall erupts in applause. Lohe nods his thanks to the young bard, a thoughtful and somber expression on his face. As Sigismondo bows and retreats, Auriel l'Aulico steps forward again.)**

**AURIEL L'AULICO**
And now, the ambassadors of the Border Kingdoms wish to present their gifts!

**(The first ambassador, a portly, jovial man named BARON VON DUSSEL, steps forward. He represents the Kingdom of BlackSaddle, and his lavish robes are a testament to his kingdom's wealth.)**

**BARON VON DUSSEL**
(Bowing low)
Your Majesty, my king, Thalon Blacksaddle, sends his warmest congratulations. As a token of his esteem, he sends you this… a marvel of modern engineering, crafted by the master gnomes of Lantan. A weapon of fire and thunder, for a king who is both.

**(He presents a beautifully crafted pistol, its wooden stock inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The crowd murmurs in awe.)**

**KING LOHE**
(Taking the pistol and examining it with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion)
A weapon of great power indeed. Thank your king for this… generous gift.

**(The second ambassador, a stern-faced woman in immaculate military attire, GENERAL SABINA MERRING, steps forward. She represents the Archduchy of Emyrs, and her bearing is that of a seasoned warrior.)**

**GENERAL SABINA MERRING**
(With a crisp bow)
Your Majesty, the Archduke of Emyrs sends his greetings. He sends you this standard, carried by his own guard in the assault on the Citadel. You will see the rent here, where a blade meant for the bearer was turned aside. The threads around the cut are enchanted, a minor rune of protection, a symbol of our shared struggle and our enduring alliance.

**(She presents a magnificent banner, its silk embroidered with the crest of Emyrs. A jagged tear in the fabric is visible, stitched with shimmering silver thread.)**

**KING LOHE**
A symbol of our shared history and our shared future. We are grateful.

**(The third ambassador, a wizened old man with a long white beard and the simple robes of a scholar, MASTER ELAR, steps forward. He represents the Kingdom of the Ready Sword.)**

**MASTER ELAR**
(His voice is frail, but his eyes are sharp)
Your Majesty, my king sends a gift not of war, but of thought. A reminder that time is the most precious of all commodities. It is not magic, but a machine, a clock. It measures the passing of the hours, the minutes, the seconds. A tool to help a king rule his days, and not be ruled by them.

**(He presents a large, ornate clock, its gears and cogs whirring softly. The crowd is silent, intrigued by the unusual gift. None have seen its like before.)**

**KING LOHE**
(A flicker of a sad smile on his lips)
An apt reminder, old friend. We thank you.

**(Lohe listens for a moment, then turns to Roberts.)**

**KING LOHE**
(His voice barely a whisper)
I am tired, my friend. I need to rest.

**ROBERTS**
(Nodding)
Of course, Your Majesty. I will make your excuses.

**(Roberts signals to Dastan, who moves to the king’s side. Together, they help Lohe to his feet and escort him from the hall. The crowd, caught up in the revelry, barely notices their departure.)**

#### SCENE C: THE CHALICE

**SETTING:** The Great Hall, moments after King Lohe has departed. The feast continues, though the highest nobles at the head table are more subdued. THEODORE ROBERTS, LORD ROBERTS' handsome and proud son, is laughing and accepting congratulations from other young nobles.

A servant, unremarkable and cloaked in simple livery, approaches the high table. He carries a bouquet of flowers.

**SERVANT**
(Voice is a low, respectful whisper)
A gift for the son of the Chancellor. From a secret admirer, who wishes you a long and prosperous future.

**THEODORE**
(Laughing, taking the flowers)
A secret admirer! Father, did you hear that? It seems my charms have not gone unnoticed.
(He winks at a nearby lady, who giggles.)

**LORD ROBERTS**
(With a dismissive wave, though a flicker of pride is in his eyes)
Do not let it go to your head, boy. Drink your wine.

Theodore raises the goblet high.

**THEODORE**
A toast! To the new King! And to a prosperous future for us all!

He drinks deeply from the goblet. As he does, a wave of cold washes over the high table. The torches in the hall flicker violently, casting dancing, distorted shadows on the walls. The silver goblet in Theodore’s hand begins to change. The polished silver darkens, turning to a matte, light-absorbing black obsidian. Vile, shadowy tendrils seem to writhe across its surface, and a symbol, a dark purple disk bordered by a deep purple circle, glows with a malevolent light on its side.

**DASTAN**
(Jumping to his feet, his face pale with horror, pointing a trembling finger)
By the Vigilant One! That is no goblet! It is the Calice dell'Eterno!

Theodore screams. It is a choked, horrifying sound. He drops the chalice, which clatters to the stone floor, emitting a puff of black smoke. His hands fly to his throat as his body begins to lose its substance. His skin turns translucent, his features blurring into a shifting mass of darkness. His fine clothes melt away into the growing shadow that is consuming him.

**LORD ROBERTS**
(His voice, usually so controlled, is a raw cry of anguish)
THEODORE!

He rushes to his son, but his hands pass through the shifting form, feeling nothing but an unnatural cold. YHULIA VELAN is at his side, her face a mask of shock, her hand on his arm.

**ANDRAS**
(Rushing forward, her hands glowing with divine light)
Hold on, child!

She thrusts her hands towards the shadow-figure, but the holy light sputters and dies as it touches the darkness, recoiling as if burned.

**ANDRAS**
(In disbelief)
My magic… it does nothing! This is a curse of the deepest shadow… a curse of Shar!

The servant who offered the cup is gone, vanished in the chaos. DASTAN and TOK-NAK are shouting orders, trying to restore calm, but panic is spreading through the hall.

The transformation is complete. Where Theodore Roberts once stood, there is now a humanoid shape of pure, silent darkness, its form vaguely mimicking the young man it once was.

**LORD ROBERTS**
(Falling to his knees, his face a portrait of utter devastation)
My son… my boy… what have they done to you?

The shadow-figure lets out a low, whispering hiss that sounds like the rustling of dry leaves in a forgotten tomb, a sound of pure loss. It takes one step back, melting into the larger shadows of the Great Hall, and is gone.

**(Most of the servants, led by the head cook, Gertude, unsheathe their knives and start a dark chant)**
The blade will drink the blood of Heim's exorcism. The ruby will be the root of the immortal empire. Praise and glory to the Ninth Daughter.

**TOK-NAK**
(Gripping his warhammer tightly, his voice a low growl)
This is no ordinary curse. This is a dark ritual, a sacrilege against the Light. Diaconi, let's defend the king and the kingdom!

The Calice dell'Eterno lies on the floor, empty and waiting. The feast has ended in horror. A new, dark chapter has begun.

**(The curtain falls on the horrified faces of the council and the heartbroken sobs of Lord Roberts.)**

**(END OF THE PROLOGUE)**
