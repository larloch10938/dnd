THE RUBY CORONATION

SECTION TWO: THE CORONATION

SCENE: THE VIGIL AND PREPARATION

SETTING: An austere, private chapel within the ducal palace. Simple stone walls, a single stained-glass window depicting the watchful eye of Helm. A simple wooden prayer kneeler and a cot are present. The air is cool and still. The magnificent Shield of Lohe rests on a velvet cushion on a small altar. Stripped of his ducal robes, DUKE LOHE WOOD stands before the Shield, clad only in a simple linen undertunic. His breathing is shallow, and a slight tremor runs through his hands.

(The scene opens with DUKE LOHE kneeling with difficulty on the prayer kneeler. He has spent the night in prayer, with only Ser Dastan by his side. It is dawn. A slight tremor runs through his hands as he clasps them. DASTAN stands beside him, a reassuring presence.)

DUKE LOHE: (Voice slightly hoarse, a low murmur) "Spirits of this land, ancestors of my line... if ever I needed strength, it is now. Not for myself..." (He pauses, a subtle cough suppressed in his chest, a grimace of pain quickly masked) "...but for Chasir-Asak. For Noah."

(Lohe reaches a trembling hand towards the Shield of Lohe, his fingers brushing the cold metal.)

DUKE LOHE: (To himself, almost a whisper) "This weight... it is more than steel and wood. It is the burden of every soul in this realm. Will I be strong enough to bear it, even for a little longer? Or will the vultures descend before my son is ready?"

(He coughs again, this time more noticeably, a dry, rasping sound. DASTAN instinctively places a hand on his shoulder.)

DASTAN: (Quietly, firmly) "Your Grace, you have borne it with honor thus far. The people know their Duke. Soon, they will know their King."

DUKE LOHE: (Sighs, the sound heavy with unspoken fears) "The people know what we allow them to know, Dastan. Roberts ensures that. But what of those who peer deeper? Boris... his eyes are like a winter in Icewind Dale. Cold and unchanging." He tries to rise, but his knee gives way slightly. Dastan's arm is there instantly, steadying him.

(LORD ROBERTS, GENERAL TOK-NAK, and DUCHESS ANDRAS enter silently. They are dressed in more formal, yet still practical, attire suitable for the pre-ceremony. They see for the first time the extent of the grey pestilence, which now covers a good portion of Lohe's body. They are startled, but hide it.)

ROBERTS:

Your Grace. The hour approaches. Are you ready?

DUKE LOHE:

(Straightens his posture with visible effort, adopting a more regal bearing)

As ready as one can be, Roberts, for the fulfillment of my destiny and... (He lets the sentence hang, looking again towards the Shield).

TOK-NAK:

(His voice a low rumble)

The men are ready, Your Grace. The people are gathering. The anticipation hums in the air.

ANDRAS:

(Approaching Lohe gently)

Your Grace, I see that your body is fighting, but I fear it is a battle it will not win. But perhaps with my prayers...

DUKE LOHE:

(Subtly avoids her touch, forcing another smile)

Not now, Andras. Not yet. There will be time for remedies later. Today, I just need to stand.

(He takes a step towards the prayer kneeler, but stumbles. DASTAN is there instantly, grabbing his arm, steadying him. Lohe grips Dastan's arm tightly for a moment, his knuckles white. He takes a deep, shaky breath, which turns into a silent, suppressed cough, quickly masked by pressing a hand to his mouth.)

ROBERTS:

(Watching Lohe carefully, his eyes narrowing almost imperceptibly)

The weight of the crown is great, even before it is worn.

DUKE LOHE:

(Recovering his composure, though still leaning slightly on Dastan)

Indeed, Chancellor. A weight I have borne as Duke, and which I will now bear as King. But it is not the weight of the crown that worries me on this day... (He looks towards the cot, then back at his assembled council) ...it is the fear of failing this kingdom, of leaving Noah... alone.

ANDRAS:

(Her voice soft, but firm)

He has good counselors, Your Grace. And loyal hearts surrounding him.

DUKE LOHE:

(A flash of something like desperation in his eyes)

Loyal hearts... and circling vultures. Boris watches, ever ready to exploit weakness. And Duchess Numesti... she has her own ambitions for the succession.

TOK-NAK:

(Gripping the hilt of his warhammer)

Let them come. My hammer remembers oaths of fealty.

DUKE LOHE:

(Nods, a genuine warmth in his gaze towards the dwarf and Dastan)

And I am grateful for such loyalty. But a king's strength must be his own. (He steps away from Dastan, standing on his own, though his hands still tremble slightly.) This sickness... it has stolen time from me. Time I needed to ensure Noah's path was clear. (He looks at the Shield again, then back at his council) The coronation... it is not simply a ceremony. It is armor. Once I am King, I can make... arrangements... Guarantees. For Noah. For the kingdom.

ROBERTS:

(Stepping forward, holding a simple, clean tunic)

Then let us don that armor, Your Grace. The people await their King.

(Lohe nods. DASTAN steps forward to help Lohe with the tunic. Lohe struggles slightly with the movement, needing Dastan's steady hand on his back. He takes another shallow breath, wincing. Andras exchanges a quick, worried glance with Roberts. Tok-Nak watches Lohe with a deep, unwavering gaze.)

(As the others prepare, Lohe reaches out and places his hand on the Shield, resting it there for a moment as if to draw strength. The tremor in his hand seems to lessen slightly, replaced by a grim resolve. He turns to face his council, his posture regaining some of its former dignity.)

DUKE LOHE:

Let us proceed. For Chasir-Asak. For the Ruby.

(Lohe walks with careful dignity, subtly assisted by Dastan, towards the chapel exit. Roberts, Tok-Nak, and Andras follow, their faces a mixture of concern and determination.)

SCENE: THE GRAND PROCESSION THROUGH ALLANIA

SETTING: The main thoroughfares of Allania. Banners and tapestries in the vibrant colors of the Ruby (red and gold) hang from buildings. Flowers adorn windowsills. The air is filled with distant music, the murmur of the crowd, and occasional cheers.

(SOUND of trumpets blaring.)

(The GRAND PROCESSION begins to move through the streets.)

(AURIEL THE COURTIER, the Royal Herald, a figure in splendid livery, rides near the head, his voice clear and resonant.)

AURIEL THE COURTIER

Hear ye, hear ye! The Coronation Procession of His Grace, Lohe Wood, Duke of the Ruby, soon to be crowned King of Chasir-Asak! Make way for your sovereign!

(Description of the procession by the DM)

(Behind the front ranks, the key figures move. LORD ROBERTS and YHULIA VELAN ride or walk close together, their eyes scanning the faces of the crowd.)

ROBERTS

(In a low voice, to Yhulia)

Watch their reactions, my dear. Are they cheering the Duke, or just the spectacle?

YHULIA

(Discreetly adjusting a fold of her rich cloak)

The cheers are loud enough. But notice the hands that remain in pockets, the eyes that watch without warmth.

(BORIS, the High Priest of Helm, stern in the silver and black of his order, walks with other senior clerics. His gaze is piercing, assessing not only the crowd's enthusiasm, but who is showing it.)

BORIS

(To a nearby cleric, in a low, almost imperceptible tone)

Note the merchants from Varnhold. Their cheers are... restrained. A detail to be explored later.

(The procession continues, passing the STATUE OF FILIE, protector of the city. A brief moment of silence and reverence falls over the crowd. Some citizens touch their heads or say a prayer. Boris bows his head stiffly in respect.)

AURIEL: "Let us pause to honor Filie the Brave, first chancellor of the city, protector of the realm!"

(The music swells again – a mix of trumpets, drums, and a small choir singing a hymn to the watchful protection of Helm and the generosity of Waukeen.)

(A disorderly group of COMMONERS, some leaning on crutches, others with children showing signs of illness, bursts from a narrow alley as Yhulia and Roberts pass. Their faces are marked by suffering, their eyes lit with desperate hope. They push against the line of City Guards.)

COMMONER 1

(Hoarse voice, holding out a trembling hand towards Yhulia)

Lady Yhulia! The Celestials! A blessing for my daughter! She burns with fever!

COMMONER 2

(An elderly woman, her face gaunt, tries to push past a guard)

Mercy, noble Lady! Just a touch! Master Akiros! A prayer from the herald of Tempus!

COMMONER 3

(Shouting, his voice breaking)

The Celestials walk among us! Share your grace! We are desperate!

(The City Guards, initially taken aback by the vehemence of the small crowd, push back forcefully, trying to maintain the line. It is not a riot, but a chaotic, emotional wave that briefly disrupts the solemnity of the procession. Some onlookers gasp, others murmur nervously.)

YHULIA

(Her expression turns to compassion. She makes a gesture as if to reach out, her voice gentle but firm.)

Good people, please! I see your suffering, but…

ROBERTS

(Discreetly places a hand on Yhulia's arm, a restraining gesture. A sharp, not loud, word to the Captain of the Guards.)

Captain, maintain order! This is unseemly. The Duke's procession must not be hindered!

(Before the Captain can react, GENERAL TOK-NAK, hitherto impassive, moves with surprising agility. He does not draw his warhammer, but stands as an armored barrier, his voice a roar that cuts through the noise.)

TOK-NAK

Hold! Show respect! There are proper channels for grievances and petitions! Back!

(SET DASTAN, who has missed nothing, is already moving forward. With a sharp gesture, he reinforces the Guards with his own men. Precise orders, aimed at calming without violence.)

DASTAN

(To the guards)

Hold the line! Gently. No injuries. Create space. Let the procession continue. (To the commoners, his tone firm but not cruel) Your pleas are heard, but this is not the time. Order must prevail.

(The combined presence of Tok-Nak and Dastan, along with the guards, pushes the commoners back into the alley, their cries turning to laments. YHULIA watches them go, her face pained. She says a silent prayer.)

(DUKE LOHE, who has observed the scene with a flash of unease, recomposes himself. He nods almost imperceptibly to Dastan, acknowledging his action, before resuming a regal expression.)

(Meanwhile, BORIS, among the clerics, observes everything. His lips are tight, disapproving of the request for blessings from Yhulia and Akiros, ignoring the official clergy.)

BORIS

(To a junior cleric, hissing)

Observe, acolyte. They prostrate themselves for blessings from all the celestials, while the servants of Helm are available and ignored.

JUNIOR CLERIC

(Nervously)

They are simple people, High Priest. Perhaps they do not understand…

BORIS

(Interrupting him)

They understand what they want. Their faith is as weak as their discipline. Helm rewards the vigilant, not those who chase sentimentality. This chaos is a sign of spiritual disorder. To be corrected. Remember this scene.

(The procession resumes, the music filling the air with a more sober tone. It reaches the REPAIRED BREACH IN THE WALLS, where the owlbear once attacked. The stone is new, a reminder of the danger. SET DASTAN and TOK-NAK are vigilant. Two guards display the SHIELD OF LOHE, glittering with rubies.)

AURIEL THE COURTIER

Behold, the Shield of Lohe! A symbol of the strength that defended these walls! May the new King carry it with courage!

DUKE LOHE

(Solemnly)

Before this repaired scar, we remember the fury of nature and the vigilance required! We honor the fallen and the defenders!

(Renewed applause. TOK-NAK nods. DASTAN, proud, tightens his reins.)

DASTAN

(Forcefully)

For this shield, and the courage it represents, Allania endures!

(The DUKE rides a white palfrey, in crimson robes. Regal, but pale, the hand holding the reins trembles. ANDRAS stares at him, worried.)

DUKE LOHE

(To Dastan, quietly)

The cheers... they warm the spirit, Dastan, but they ignore what awaits them.

DASTAN

(Calmly)

Lean on me, if you need to, Your Grace.

DUKE LOHE

(With a bitter smile)

Not yet, my friend. Not yet.

(The procession resumes, heading towards the Great Cathedral. The atmosphere shifts from the open air and exuberant crowd to a more solemn aura as they approach the sacred building. The scents change from flowers and damp earth to the faint aroma of incense.)

(ROBERTS and YHULIA observe the crowd's reactions, noting the alternating enthusiasm and the groups of less involved spectators.)

ROBERTS

(In a low voice, to Yhulia)

The vassals of the West are here in force. And Andrisha feigns loyalty, but her gaze is very watchful, penetrating.

YHULIA

(Her eyes sharp and calculating)

And Edelroth's men… they are restless. What are they looking for?

(BORIS, meanwhile, continues his assessment, his hawk-like eyes identifying key figures in the crowd, memorizing faces and positions.)

BORIS

(To his cleric)

That merchant, near the North Gate… I know that face. An old supporter of El Dayan. Curious that he dares to venture into the heart of the city today.

(The procession reaches the GREAT CATHEDRAL. Waiting at the entrance is a representative from Elkwood, a hunter named Ralf, holding a magnificent RACK OF DEER ANTLERS wrapped in sheaves of golden wheat. It is the OFFERING TO THE STAG, in commemoration of Lohe's victory over the Stag Lord and the founding of Allania.)

AURIEL THE COURTIER

A tribute from the wild lands of Elkwood! A testament to the King's dominion and the prosperity of the realm!

BORIS

(In prayer, emphasizing control)

May the hand of Helm guide the King over beasts and lands. May his reign be as strong as the oak and as fruitful as the harvest.

(He says a short prayer over the antlers and wheat. Lohe bows his head, maintaining a deliberately neutral expression, though a flicker of weariness crosses his face.)

SETTING: The vast, echoing interior of the Great Cathedral. The air is thick with the scent of incense and ancient stone. Stained-glass windows depict scenes of Helm's divine power, Waukeen's benevolent gaze, and the legendary victory of the Deacons over the owlbear. The High Altar is draped in rich cloth of deep red and gold. A temporary throne, simple but dignified, is placed near the altar.

(The sound of the crowd and the external music fades, replaced by the echoing acoustics of the Cathedral. A CHOIR begins to sing a solemn, majestic hymn.)

(The Procession enters the Cathedral. The order is somewhat reversed, with the highest-ranking officials and nobles entering first. DUKE LOHE enters almost last, still flanked by DASTAN and TOK-NAK. His pace is now slower, the fatigue of the procession weighing on him.)

(BORIS, standing near the High Altar with seven other Celestials, watches Lohe's entrance, his hands clasped before him.)

BORIS (In a low voice to a cleric beside him) See how he leans? The whispers are not unfounded.

(Lohe is guided to the chair of state near the altar. He sinks into it with a visible slump of his shoulders before quickly straightening himself. Dastan remains close, a hand subtly resting on the back of the chair. Tok-Nak stands firm, a granite pillar beside the throne.)

(Boris steps forward, facing the assembled congregation. His voice, normally sharp, takes on a deep, resonant quality, suited to the sacred place.)

BORIS Welcome, all, to this consecrated house of Helm. Today, we gather under the ever-open eye of him who watches to witness a sacred transition. Here, within these walls, the temporal power of a Duke will be blessed and consecrated into the divine right of a King.

(He pauses, his gaze sweeping over the faces before him. His eyes linger for a moment on Lohe, then on Roberts and Andras.)

BORIS May the light of Helm illuminate the path of our new sovereign. May His strength infuse his spirit... and his flesh. For the burdens of kingship are great, and require a constitution blessed by the divine. Let us pray.

(Boris leads a brief, formal prayer, his words ostensibly for the King's well-being and the prosperity of the kingdom, but delivered with a measured cadence that subtly emphasizes the 'burdens' and the need for 'constitution'.)

(As Boris speaks, Lohe closes his eyes for a brief moment, a look of weariness etched on his face. Andras watches him, her brow furrowed with concern. Roberts and Yhulia exchange a quick, meaningful glance.)

(At the end of the prayer, Boris gestures towards the altar.)

BORIS Let the sacred rites begin. Let the chosen one be prepared for the touch of the divine.

(The Choir's hymn swells again. Attendants step forward to assist Lohe.)

(Lohe kneels on a velvet cushion before the altar. Assisting clerics help to unfasten the top of his simple undertunic, exposing his chest.)

(A young cleric reverently presents a silver vial, ancient and decorated with the symbols of the eight deities. The oil is thick. Boris holds it up for a moment, then turns to the Celestials.)

BORIS (continues)
Brothers and Sisters in faith, guardians of the sacred bonds of Chasir-Asak. The time has come to consecrate this vessel and, through it, our chosen sovereign. May the united power of the divine infuse this holy oil.

(The Celestials form a semicircle before Lohe. Boris places the open vial on a small, ornate stand brought forward by an acolyte. A faint, acrid smell emanates from it, a testament to its ancient preservation mixed with traditional oils.)

One by one, each Celestial steps forward slightly, extending a hand over the vial and evoking their most powerful spell with a sacred gesture towards it, as their voices ring out clearly in the cathedral.

HIGH PRIEST BORIS (HELM)
(Hand steady, palm facing down over the vial)
By the Watchful Eye of Helm, may this oil grant clarity of purpose and unwavering protection against all threats to the innocent! May it reveal truth and fortify resolve!

(A fleeting glint of white light touches the oil.)

LADY YHULIA (WAUKEEN)
(Sprinkling a pinch of gold dust that vanishes near the oil)
By the Golden Hand of Waukeen, may this oil attract prosperity and wisdom in the management of the kingdom's wealth! May commerce flourish and every resource abound!

(The oil thickens, taking on a faint golden glow.)

FATHER SANDERS (KELEMVOR)
(Nods slowly, his voice low but charged with strength)
By the Just Scales of Kelemvor, may this oil impart solemn judgment and understanding of the weight of mortal life! May every decision be tempered by fairness and the firmness of true justice!

(A cold, silvery aura emanates for a moment from the vial.)

SHANDRA GELT (GRUMBAR)
(Strikes a small silver hammer on a granite stone held in her other hand)
By the Durgak hammer, gift of Grumbar, may this oil grant the strength of the mountains and the tenacity of dwarven steel! May the kingdom rest on solid foundations and its people be industrious!

(The oil darkens slightly, as if gaining substance and depth. The acrid hint in the smell vanishes.)

JOHD KAVEN (CHAUNTEA)
(Brings a tender stalk of wheat close to the oil)
By the Fruitful Harvest of Chauntea, may this oil foster growth, ensure sustenance, and bind the King to the land of his kingdom! May the countryside be fertile and the people prosperous!
	
(A warm, earthy scent mixes with the oil, sweetening its aroma.)

Jona the old (TYR)
(Brings a gloved fist to his chest)
By the blind justice of Tyr, may this oil instill loyalty to duty, a righteous heart, and courage against all darkness! May the King be a beacon of true loyalty!

(A flash of silver-blue light shoots from the vial.)

AKIROS ISMORT (TEMPUS)
(Calloused hand suspended over the vial)
By the Honored Blade of Tempus, may this oil give courage in battle, strength in adversity, and warrior's discernment! May the King's arm defend the kingdom without wavering!

(A faint scent of fresh metal pervades the oil, which now vibrates with contained power.)

ELYRA BEDAR (SELUNE)
(Touches her forehead and then the oil)
By the goddess of creation, the crescent moon, the light in the night, may this oil grant wisdom in governance, insight into the hearts of the people, and knowledge for just laws!


(The oil clears, becoming transparent and luminous.)


(The oil, now infused with divine energies, radiates an inner light. Boris takes the vial again, his eyes less calculating and more aware of the shared strength of the ritual.)

BORIS (His voice is solemn) Receive this holy oil, sanctified by the grace of Helm, Waukeen, and Kelemvor and all of us. May it set you apart, elevate you above mortal men, and bind you to the will of the divine.

(He opens the vial. The scent of the oil becomes more prominent. All eight celestials approach Lohe)

BORIS (CONT.) We anoint you on the head…... (The eight celestials touch Lohe's forehead with the oil. Their touch is firm) ...that your mind may be enlightened by the wisdom of Helm.

(Lohe shudders slightly at the touch, his breath momentarily catching.)

BORIS (CONT.) ...on the breast... (He touches Lohe's chest) ...that your heart may be filled with courage and righteousness.

(The entire cathedral holds its breath)

BORIS (CONT.) ...and on the hands... (He anoints Lohe's palms) ...that your actions may be guided by justice and strength.

(As Boris speaks the words, his tone is precise, almost clinical)

BORIS (CONT.) May the gaze of Helm pierce the veil of mortality... (He looks directly into Lohe's eyes for a long moment)... and reveal the true strength that lies within.

(Lohe closes his eyes, a bead of sweat trickling down his temple. He takes a slow, shaky breath. Andras bites her lip, her hands clasped. Roberts watches Boris intently, a flash of unease in his eyes)

---

ALL CELESTIALS Be blessed and consecrated King over this realm, by the authority granted to the Church!

---

(The power of the oil seems to have an invigorating power, and Lohe stands up. For a moment he is again the Shield of Allania, the hope of his people, the bastion on which the nation was founded.)

BORIS (To the assisting clerics) Prepare him for the vestments.

(The assisting clerics gently wipe away the excess oil and prepare Lohe for the next stage. Lohe returns to kneeling for a moment, his head bowed, seemingly gathering his strength.)

(Lohe, helped to his feet, stands as the attendants begin the process of dressing him in the ceremonial robes. First a simple linen tunic, then a heavier dalmatic embroidered with the symbols of the Ruby, followed by a long, flowing mantle of deep crimson, lined with ermine.)

(This process is physically taxing for Lohe. He sways slightly. Andras watches, her healing instincts at odds with the formality of the ritual.)

BORIS (Presiding over the investiture, his voice formal and sonorous) Receive these vestments, symbols of your royal dignity and the sacred office to which you are called.

(As each piece of regalia is presented, Boris or another official expounds its symbolic meaning. The items are brought forward by the Celestials.)

(Akiros presents the bracelets)

AKIROS Receive these armills, symbols of divine sincerity and wisdom.

(YHULIA presents the RING OF MONARCHY.)

YHULIA (Holding a heavy ring, set with a large ruby) Receive this ring, a sign of the covenant you make today with your people and with the faith that guides them. Wear it as a sign of your fidelity.

(She slides the ring onto Lohe's finger. Lohe's hand trembles.)

(DASTAN steps forward, bearing the SHIELD OF STATE – Lohe's own battle-scarred shield, bearing the Ruby crest.)

DASTAN (Voice clear and strong) Your Grace, receive this Shield of State, a symbol of your duty to administer justice and defend the realm from all enemies!

(He presents the Shield to Lohe, who takes it for a brief moment before it is placed nearby.)

(BORIS stands before Lohe, holding the CROWN – the twisted diadem of rubies and iron. It is heavy, ornate, a powerful symbol. He then passes it to Lord ROBERTS.)

ROBERTS (His voice slow, deliberate) Receive this Crown, the sign of your sovereignty, placed upon your head by the authority of the divine. May it weigh heavily, a constant reminder of your burdens... and your power.

(He raises the Crown. Roberts' gaze is fixed on the Crown, then on Lohe. There is a brief, pregnant pause before Roberts lowers the Crown onto Lohe's head. Lohe closes his eyes for a moment, bracing himself. The sheer weight of the iron and rubies seems to press down on him, forcing him to dip slightly before he straightens his shoulders with renewed effort.)

(Tok-Nak is ready, with the CEREMONIAL SWORD OF STATE, a heavy two-handed weapon.)

TOK-NAK (Presenting the sword) By the might of Moradin, receive this blade, a symbol of your duty to protect the innocent and strike down the wicked! May your arm be strong and your judgment true!

(Lohe takes the sword for a moment, gripping the hilt firmly before it is placed within easy reach.)

(Fully robed and invested with the regalia, Lohe appears regal, imposing, despite the pallor of his face and the tremor in his hand resting on the arm of his chair.)

BORIS (Stepping back, a look of satisfaction on his face) The King is robed. Now, let him take the sacred oath.

(Silence falls over the Cathedral. The atmosphere is thick with anticipation. KING LOHE sits on the throne, his eyes fixed on the Tome of the Holy Church of Allania.)

BORIS (His voice ringing out, formal and unyielding) Your Majesty, you stand before Helm and all present to take the sacred Coronation Oath. Place your hand upon the Holy Tome.

(Lohe raises a gloved hand, the tremor now more noticeable. He reaches for the Tome.)

(Lohe places his hand on the ancient, heavy binding of the Tome. The symbol of Helm is deeply embossed on the cover.)

BORIS (CONT.) Repeat after me, and swear upon your life and soul, by the divine grace granted to you, and for the future of this kingdom.

(Boris recites the phrases of the oath, line by line, with Lohe repeating after him. Lohe's voice starts strong, but shows signs of strain.)

BORIS I, Lohe, will govern the people of Chasir-Asak...

KING LOHE (Voice slightly hoarse) I, Lohe, will govern the people of Chasir-Asak...

BORIS ...according to their ancient rights and customs...

KING LOHE ...according to their ancient rights and customs...

(Lohe emphasizes "ancient rights," casting a subtle glance at the assembled nobles. Some nods of approval are visible, but others remain impassive.)

BORIS ...will dispense justice with equity and mercy...

KING LOHE ...will dispense justice with equity and mercy...

BORIS ...will uphold and protect the Holy Church and all its followers...

KING LOHE ...will uphold and protect the Holy Church and all its followers...

BORIS ...and will defend this realm from all its enemies, both external and internal.

KING LOHE ...and will defend this realm from all its enemies, both external and internal.

(He takes a deep, shaky breath.)

BORIS (His voice softens, almost imperceptibly, but with a chilling tone) Do you swear this oath, King Lohe, with a sincere heart and an unwavering spirit?

KING LOHE (Meeting Boris's gaze, his own full of a weary defiance) I do. So help me Helm.

(He withdraws his hand from the Tome. Roberts gently closes the book.)

BORIS The Oath is sworn. Let the Homage be rendered.

(Boris and Roberts move slightly to the side, as the nobles prepare to come forward.)



THE HOMAGE OF THE ESTATES

SETTING: Before the newly crowned King Lohe, seated on his throne. The floor before the throne is clear.

(The representatives of the various estates – the clergy, followed by the nobility – approach the throne in order of precedence to swear fealty to the newly crowned King. The atmosphere is a mixture of formal ritual and underlying political tension.)

(The highest-ranking members of the clergy kneel first, led by BORIS.)

BORIS (Formal voice) We, the servants of Helm and the Holy Church, swear fealty to you, our liege and King, saving our obedience to the divine. We will uphold your just rule and pray for your prosperity.

(The other Celestials repeat the oath. Lohe nods, offering a faint smile.)

(Next, the Nobles approach. They kneel one by one, placing their hands between the King's, a gesture of submission.)

(DUCHESS ANDRAS kneels, her expression one of deep respect and loyalty.)

ANDRAS My liege, I, Andras, Duchess of the Ruby, swear my fealty and the fealty of my lands and people. May your reign be long and just.

(Lohe clasps her hands warmly, a genuine affection in his eyes.)

KING LOHE Your loyalty is the bedrock of this kingdom, Andras. I count on it.

(BARON WILLIAM EDELROTH, father of Aethan, from the Duchy of the West, approaches. He hesitates before kneeling, his gaze direct.)

BARON EDELROTH (Voice clear, though respectful) Your Majesty. I, William Edelroth, offer my homage... conditional upon the reaffirmation of my son William's rightful claim to the lands of Izra, a right paid for in blood.

(A tense silence falls over the Cathedral. Lohe's face tightens. Roberts watches Edelroth with narrowed eyes. Boris's jaw clenches.)

KING LOHE (After a moment, his voice carefully measured) Baron Edelroth. The ancient rights and claims of my loyal vassals will be reviewed and confirmed in due course, according to law and tradition. You have my royal word.

(Edelroth hesitates for another moment, then slowly kneels, placing his hands in Lohe's. The gesture seems reluctant.)

BARON EDELROTH I offer my homage, Your Majesty.

(Lohe clasps his hands briefly, his expression inscrutable. Edelroth rises and steps away.)

(The REGENT OF VARNHOLD, ANDRISHA, approaches. She kneels and swears her fealty, wearing a conspicuous EMERALD PENDANT – the colors of the Duke of the East, Roberts.)

ANDRISHA Your Majesty, I, Andrisha, Regent of Varnhold, swear fealty to you and your crown. May peace and prosperity reign.

(Other nobles offer their homage, some with genuine enthusiasm, others with formal correctness, some with barely veiled ambition or resentment in their eyes. Lohe receives each one, his strength visibly waning, though he maintains his regal composure.)

(DASTAN and TOK-NAK do not swear homage in this formal sense, their loyalty being understood through their offices and proximity to the King.)

(Boris watches each noble carefully, noting their demeanor, the speed of their kneeling, the sincerity of their oaths. Roberts and Yhulia continue to observe the political undercurrents.)

(The Homage concludes.)

BORIS The Estates have rendered their homage.

(The nobles return to their places.)

THE SILENT CHALLENGE AND THE ACCLAMATION

SETTING: The main nave of the Cathedral. KING LOHE is seated on his throne. All the main characters and assembled figures are in their places.

(AURIEL THE COURTIER, the Royal Herald, steps forward, standing in a prominent position where his voice can carry throughout the vast Cathedral.)

AURIEL THE COURTIER (His voice rings out, formal and imposing) Hear ye, hear ye! Let it be known throughout the realm! If there is any here present who disputes the right of Lohe Wood to be crowned King of Chasir-Asak, let them speak now!

(A deep SILENCE falls over the Cathedral. The air is thick with tension. Every eye is fixed on the Herald, then on the assembled crowd, searching for any sign of dissent.)

(Absolute silence)

(BORIS's jaw clenches, his eyes darting between the nobles. He seems almost disappointed by the lack of a challenge.)

(TOK-NAK's hand moves instinctively to the hilt of his warhammer, his eyes scanning the assembly with a fierce, protective glare – a clear, silent threat to anyone contemplating breaking the peace.)

(DASTAN stands stiffly, his gaze fixed and vigilant, ready to act at the slightest sign of trouble.)

(ROBERTS and YHULIA watch the crowd intently, their expressions neutral, but their eyes missing nothing. They look for hesitation, fear, hidden defiance.)

(ANDRAS watches Lohe, her concern evident. Lohe himself sits perfectly still, his face pale but resolute.)

(The silence stretches, tense and heavy, for several long moments. No voice is raised in challenge.)

(AURIEL THE COURTIER scans the assembly one last time, then turns to the throne.)

AURIEL THE COURTIER (CONT.) There being no challenge...

(He raises his voice, addressing the assembly.)

AURIEL THE COURTIER (CONT.) Then let us proclaim him! By the grace of Helm, by the will of the people, and by the ancient rights of the realm, I declare Lohe Wood... KING OF CHASIR-ASAK!

(BORIS, despite his previous demeanor, is the first to raise his voice in formal acclamation. Perhaps with a touch of irony, or simply embracing the inevitable.)

BORIS (Thundering voice) LONG LIVE KING LOHE!

(The assembled clergy and nobles, after a brief moment of hesitation from some, join the cry. The sound swells, echoing through the Cathedral.)

ASSEMBLED VOICES LONG LIVE KING LOHE! LONG LIVE THE KING!

(The cry is taken up by any commoners present inside the Cathedral, and perhaps faintly, by the crowd outside. The sound is a mixture of genuine applause, formal acclamation, and perhaps some more subdued or reluctant voices.)

(Lohe watches the acclamation, his expression complex – a mixture of weariness, relief, and grim determination. He raises a hand, gloved and trembling, in acknowledgment.)

(Roberts and Yhulia allow themselves a brief, almost imperceptible smile of satisfaction. Tok-Nak strikes his warhammer once on the stone floor with a resonant thud, a sound of solid approval. Dastan relaxes slightly, though his vigilance remains.)

(The cries of "Long live the King!" fill the Cathedral as the Section concludes.)
