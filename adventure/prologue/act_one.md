THE RUBY CORONATION

 

A Prologue for the Chasir-Asak Campaign

 

SECTION ONE: POLITICS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

 

[The scene opens in the private council chamber of the ducal palace in Allania. A large oak table dominates the center, surrounded by ornately carved chairs. Tapestries depicting the history of Chasir-Asak adorn the walls, with the symbol of the ruby and shield prominently displayed. A large map of the duchy is spread across the table. Candles and oil lamps cast a warm glow in the room, though shadows linger in the corners. The chamber has high, narrow windows with stained glass depicting acts of heroism by the Deacons.]

 

[Enter DUKE LOHE WOOD, a man in his late sixties, dressed in rich crimson robes trimmed with ermine. Though regal in bearing, his face appears slightly gaunt, with dark circles under his eyes carefully concealed. He moves with a deliberate slowness that could be mistaken for dignity.]

 

[Following him is LORD ROBERTS, the Chancellor, a portly man in his sixties with calculating eyes and a slovenly appearance. He carries several scrolls and a ledger.]

 

[Enter GENERAL TOK-NAK, a sturdy dwarf warrior with a braided beard adorned with small ruby clasps. His ceremonial armor bears the marks of many battles, and he carries a warhammer that serves as both a weapon and a symbol of his office.]

 

[Next is CAPTAIN SET DASTAN, a tall, vigilant human with the weathered face of a career soldier. His uniform is impeccable, and his hand rests habitually on the hilt of his sword.]

 

[Enter HIGH PRIEST BORIS, a stern-looking cleric of Helm in formal blue and silver ecclesiastical robes. His posture is rigid, his gaze cold and appraising as he scans the room.]

 

[YHULIA VELAN, Master of Coin, enters last. She is an elegant woman in her fifties, wearing robes of deep gold with subtle embroidery of coins and scales, symbols of Waukeen. She carries a ledger bound in fine leather.]

 

DUKE LOHE: (sitting at the head of the table) My lords, my lady, I thank you for attending this final council before tomorrow's ceremony. The elevation of Chasir-Asak from a duchy to a kingdom marks a new chapter in our history.

 

LORD ROBERTS: (arranging his scrolls) Indeed, Your Grace. Diplomatic recognition from both Blacksaddle and Emrys arrived this morning. (He slides a document towards the Duke) The formalities are complete.

 

DUKE LOHE: (examining the document, his hand trembling slightly before he steadies it) Excellent. General Tok-Nak, how are the military preparations for the ceremony?

 

TOK-NAK: (gruffly) Three hundred of my finest warriors will line the processional route, Your Grace. Another two hundred guard the city walls. No one will disturb your coronation, every one of my soldiers' honor guarantees it.

 

CAPTAIN DASTAN: My city guard will maintain order among the crowds. We expect visitors from every corner of the duchy—soon to be a kingdom.

 

DUKE LOHE: (nodding) Good. (He suppresses a cough, reaching for a goblet of water) Boris, the cathedral's preparations?

 

HIGH PRIEST BORIS: (with cold formality) The Cathedral of the Unsleeping Eye is ready to receive its first king, Your Grace. The blessing of Helm awaits you. (with subtle emphasis) I have personally overseen every detail of the sacred rites.

 

LORD ROBERTS: The blessing of Helm and all the other Celestials, you mean, Grand Master?

 

BORIS: (impatiently) Exactly!

 

DUKE LOHE: And the regalia?

 

BORIS: (with a thin smile) The crown, the scepter, and most importantly, the shield rest on the altar, awaiting tomorrow's ceremony. The crown in particular is... quite heavy. (watching Lohe carefully) I wonder if Your Grace has the strength to bear such a weight.

 

DUKE LOHE: (sharply) My strength is sufficient, High Priest. (He rises, moving towards the map on the table, though he grips the edge for support when he thinks no one is looking)

 

YHULIA: (intervening smoothly) The treasury has allocated funds for both the ceremony and the subsequent festivities, Your Grace. The new royal mint has produced commemorative coins with your effigy. (She produces a silver coin)

 

LORD ROBERTS: (examining the coin) Excellent craftsmanship. The people will appreciate such tangible symbols of our new status. [Yhulia's fingers brush against Roberts' hand as she takes the coin back.]

 

DUKE LOHE: Now, let us turn to matters of substance. The heraldry of our new kingdom must reflect both our heritage and our aspirations. (He unrolls a scroll showing several designs) The shield has long been our symbol, but as a kingdom, we might consider additions.

 

TOK-NAK: (bluntly) Keep the ruby. Add a warhammer. Simple, strong.

 

LORD ROBERTS: (diplomatically) Perhaps something more... astute, General. The ruby certainly remains central, but we could incorporate elements representing our three duchies.

 

BORIS: (coldly) The Eye of Helm would be an appropriate addition. The church's support is, after all, essential for... Your Grace's continued reign.

 

DUKE LOHE: (with a flash of irritation) The church's support is appreciated, High Priest, but Chasir-Asak is not a theocracy.

YHULIA: (nodding) A wise choice, Your Grace. It honors tradition while embracing your vision for the future.

 

LORD ROBERTS: (making a note) It shall be proclaimed as the royal coat of arms tomorrow.

 

DUKE LOHE: (moving to another scroll) Now, to the matter of succession. (He pauses, suppressing another cough) Prince Noah must be formally recognized as heir.

 

BORIS: (with calculated concern) The prince is young, Your Grace. Barely twenty. If something... unfortunate... were to happen to you, a regency might be necessary.

 

TOK-NAK: (bluntly) The boy has a good heart but knows nothing of war or leadership.

 

CAPTAIN DASTAN: (loyally) He has made progress in his martial training, Your Grace. With time—

 

DUKE LOHE: (interrupting) Time is precisely what we must ensure for him. (His voice strengthens with determination) Noah will be named heir tomorrow, without ambiguity. If a regency were necessary—which it will not be—Lord Roberts would serve as regent, assisted by a council composed of all of you.

 

[Boris's expression darkens momentarily before he recomposes himself.]

 

LORD ROBERTS: (bowing his head) I am honored by Your Grace's trust.

 

YHULIA: (carefully) A wise contingency, though one we hope never to have to implement. (She exchanges a meaningful glance with Roberts)

DUKE LOHE: (sitting back down, visibly tired) Finally, we must address the composition of the Deacons—the royal council that will advise the crown.

 

LORD ROBERTS: (unrolling a scroll) I have prepared a list of proposed seats and appointments, Your Grace.

 

DUKE LOHE: (examining the list) The traditional offices, of course—Chancellor, General, Captain of the Guard, High Priest, Master of Spies, Magister, Master of Coin. But I see you have added representatives from each duchy.

 

LORD ROBERTS: To ensure balanced governance, Your Grace. The Duchy of the West, the Duchy of the Ruby, and the Duchy of the East should have a voice in your councils.

 

TOK-NAK: (suspiciously) And Gul Nak? My county answers directly to the crown.

 

LORD ROBERTS: (smoothly) You yourself represent those interests, General. Unless you would prefer to appoint a delegate?

 

BORIS: (interjecting) The Order of Helm should have separate representation from the church itself. The order commands a significant military force.

 

CAPTAIN DASTAN: (cautiously) The Order's loyalty has been... questionable in the past.

 

DUKE LOHE: (firmly) The Order will have a seat, but their representative will answer to you, Boris. I will not have a divided religious authority in my council.

 

BORIS: (with barely concealed displeasure) As Your Grace wishes.

 

YHULIA: (consulting her ledger) There is also the matter of the vacant Barony of Jambis and the regency of Varnhold. Both situations create... instability in our political structure.

 

LORD ROBERTS: (nodding) Appointments must be made soon, but perhaps not on the day of your coronation, Your Grace. Such decisions require careful consideration.

 

DUKE LOHE: (nodding) Agreed, but we have no time to waste.

(He rises, swaying slightly before catching himself)

[The Duke has a sudden coughing fit, turning away from the table. He takes out a handkerchief, which he quickly conceals.]

 

LORD ROBERTS: (concerned) Your Grace?

 

DUKE LOHE: (composing himself) Just a dry throat, Chancellor. The winter air.

 

BORIS: (with false solicitude) Perhaps Your Grace should rest before tomorrow's exertions. The coronation will be... demanding.

 

DUKE LOHE: (with dignity) I will retire shortly. Ser Dastan, a word in private before I do.

[The others bow and begin to exit. Yhulia brushes past Roberts as they leave]

 

TOK-NAK: (to Roberts as they exit) Keep an eye on the priest. He has the look of a man counting another's gold.

 

ROBERTS: (sotto voce) As always, my dear dwarf.

 

[They all exit except for DUKE LOHE and DASTAN.]

 

DUKE LOHE: (once alone, his posture slumps with fatigue) How bad is it, old friend?

 

DASTAN: (concerned) The clerics speak of three months, perhaps six with their treatments. No more.

 

DUKE LOHE: (grimly) Not enough time to secure Noah's position.

 

DASTAN: (carefully) No, Your Grace. The vultures are already circling. Boris has been meeting privately with the spymaster. The Duchess of the West questions Noah's readiness.

 

DUKE LOHE: (with determination) Then we must accelerate our plans. The coronation is not a mere ceremony—it is armor. Once I am king, certain... arrangements can be made that a mere duke could not secure.

 

DASTAN: (nodding) I understand, Your Grace. And I will see it done.

 

DUKE LOHE: (placing a hand on Dastan's shoulder) I know you will. You have never failed me. (He moves towards the door, then stops) And Captain... watch over my son when I am gone. He will need your wisdom more than I ever did.

 

DASTAN: (with genuine emotion) To my last breath, Your Grace.

 

[DUKE LOHE exits, walking with careful dignity despite his weakness.] [DASTAN remains, thoughtfully examining the map.]

 

DASTAN: (softly to himself) The game grows more complex, but the prize... (He looks at the ducal throne) The prize remains the same.
