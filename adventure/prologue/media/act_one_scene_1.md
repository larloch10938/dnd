this is a depiction for a dungeon and dragon historical campaign in the drawing style of Todd Lockwood in the Forgotten Realms. The scene is the private council chamber of the ducal palace in Allania. A large oak table dominates the center, surrounded by ornately carved chairs. Tapestries depicting the history of Chasir-Asak adorn the walls, with the symbol of the ruby and shield prominently displayed. A large map of the duchy is spread across the table. Candles and oil lamps cast a warm glow in the room, though shadows linger in the corners. The chamber has high, narrow windows with stained glass depicting acts of heroism by the Deacons.
