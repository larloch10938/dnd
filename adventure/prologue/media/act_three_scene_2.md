this is a depiction for a dungeon and dragon historical campaign in the drawing style of Todd Lockwood in the Forgotten Realms. The scene is the feast in the Great Hall of the Ducal Palace. The room is a riot of color and sound. Banners of the newly proclaimed kingdom hang from the rafters. The tables are laden with food, and wine flows freely. A large fireplace roars at one end of the hall.
