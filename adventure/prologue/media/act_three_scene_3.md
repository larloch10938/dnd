this is a depiction for a dungeon and dragon historical campaign in the drawing style of Todd Lockwood in the Forgotten Realms. The scene is the Chalice. Theodore Roberts, son of the Chancellor, drinks from a silver goblet that transforms into a black obsidian chalice. Vile, shadowy tendrils writhe across its surface, and a symbol, a dark purple disk bordered by a deep purple circle, glows with a malevolent light on its side. Theodore's body begins to lose its substance, his skin turns translucent, his features blurring into a shifting mass of darkness.
