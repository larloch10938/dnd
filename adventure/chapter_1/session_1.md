Key Objectives
    1. Secure Fresh Game ‚Äì The party must bag at least three deer or a boar to feed Okton‚Äôs 80 souls. Failure means rationing bark-bread and boiled leather.
    2. Survive the Forest ‚Äì Beyond wolves and cold, the woods hide ice-covered ravines and fey traps. Superstition dictates offerings of bread or coin at shrines to Silvanus.
    3. Glimpse of Darkness ‚Äì A slain stag‚Äôs blackened tongue or wolf packs with milky eyes hint at the plague‚Äôs reach.

**Scene 1: The Journey to the Hunting Grounds**

*   **Time Spent:** The journey to the hunting grounds began at dawn, a two-day trek through the deepening snows. Each step was a battle against the biting wind and the deceptive drifts.
*   **Cold's Toll:** Even with layers of wool and thick cloaks, the cold seeped into their bones. Fingers grew stiff, breath plumed in the frigid air, and the constant ache of cold feet was a familiar companion.
*   **Tracking:** Before reaching the main hunting area, emphasize the meticulous process of tracking. Ralf, or another experienced hunter, would spend hours reading the snow ‚Äì not just for hoofprints, but for disturbed branches, scattered droppings, and the subtle scent of deer on the wind. He might point out how a deer's slot (hoofprint) changes in deep snow versus shallow, or how a broken twig indicates a hurried passage.

**Scene 2: The Hunting Camp**

*   **Living in a Tent:** As dusk fell, they sought a sheltered hollow. Simple canvas tents, perhaps reinforced with pine boughs for insulation, were quickly erected. A central fire, carefully built to minimize smoke and maximize heat, became the heart of their temporary home. The ground beneath them, though insulated with straw or more boughs, remained unforgivingly cold.
*   **Camp Life:** Evenings were spent sharpening knives, mending gear, and sharing meager rations. The air would be thick with the smell of woodsmoke, damp wool, and the faint, metallic tang of blood from a small game catch. Guards would be posted, their eyes scanning the tree line for any sign of movement, their ears straining against the wind for the tell-tale howl of a wolf.
*   **Social Hierarchy:** If applicable to your party, hint at the division of labor. While the high-level characters might discuss strategy, the low-level characters would be tasked with gathering firewood, fetching water (breaking ice from a stream), and preparing the camp.

**Scene 3: The Hunt**

*   **Deer Hunting - Status:** When they spot "A Herd in the Hollow," emphasize the social significance. Ralf might whisper about the 'hart of ten' ‚Äì a prized stag that only nobles were truly meant to hunt, but in these lean times, any venison was a blessing. The act of hunting deer, even for survival, carried a faint echo of the lordly pursuit.
*   **Wolf Ambush - Fear and Symbolism:** Reinforce the historical fear of wolves. The emaciated wolves aren't just hungry; their 'mangy coats' and 'milky eyes' could be seen as an omen, a manifestation of the 'devil, rapacity, cunning, and deceit' that medieval people associated with these creatures. The villagers' fear of them is palpable, not just for livestock but for their very souls.
*   **Hunting Methods:** If the party uses traps or tries to drive the wolves, you can reference the historical methods like "pits" or "drive hunting."

**Small Details to Pepper Throughout:**

*   **Sounds of the Forest:** The creak of frozen branches, the distant hoot of an owl, the crunch of snow underfoot, the sudden silence that precedes danger.
*   **Food and Sustenance:** Beyond the main game, characters might forage for edible roots (if any are available in winter), or chew on dried meat. The importance of fat for warmth and energy.
*   **Superstitions:** Expand on the "offerings of bread or coin at shrines to Silvanus." Perhaps Ralf warns against disturbing certain ancient trees or cairns, believing them to be fey dwellings or places where spirits linger. The idea of wolves being harbingers of plague or ill fortune.
*   **Hygiene:** The lack of it. The smell of unwashed bodies, woodsmoke, and animal hides.

Encounters & Challenges
1. Harsh Winter Conditions
    ‚Ä¢ Tracking (Survival/DC 12): The snow reveals deer slots (hoofprints) and tufts of fur on hawthorn bushes. However, a sudden snowfall (1d4 hours in) obscures trails, raising the DC to 14.
    ‚Ä¢ Cold‚Äôs Toll (Constitution Save/DC 10): Woolen cloaks and tallow-coated boots delay hypothermia, but prolonged exposure numbs fingers. Failures impose disadvantage on ranged attacks.
    ‚Ä¢ Historical Detail: Ralf teaches the party to stuff moss into their boots for insulation and chew pine needles to stave off thirst.
2. Wolf Ambush
    ‚Ä¢ Tactics: The wolves (3‚Äì5) are emaciated, ribs visible beneath mangy coats. They circle the party, targeting the smallest or weakest-looking member. If the party scatters, wolves drag down stragglers.
    ‚Ä¢ Noise Factor: Combat shouts echo through the forest. Roll a d6 post-battle: 1‚Äì3 = prey within 1 mile flees; 4‚Äì6 = a wounded boar charges the party (AC 13, 2d6+3 damage).
3. The Prey
    ‚Ä¢ A Herd in the Hollow: The party spots 4‚Äì6 deer grazing on lichen near a frozen stream. Ralf whispers, ‚ÄúAim for the lungs. A gutshot‚Äôll spoil the meat.‚Äù
    ‚Ä¢ Stealth/DC 14: Crouch behind snowdrifts and move only when the wind masks footfalls. Failure sends the herd bolting into a thicket of blackthorn bushes (1d4 slashing damage per 10 feet pursued).
    ‚Ä¢ Historical Detail: Successful kills require field dressing (Survival/DC 10) to avoid tainting the meat. The liver, rich in iron, is eaten raw by hunters to replenish strength.
4. Faerie Encounter (Optional)
    ‚Ä¢ Dancing Lights: On the return trek, will-o‚Äô-wisps flicker near a moss-coated menhir. A voice, like wind through reeds, whispers, ‚ÄúIl respiro del Ducato si affievolisce‚Äù
    ‚Ä¢ Arcana/DC 13: The fey speak in riddles, but their warning aligns with the Duke‚Äôs illness. A successful check reveals the ‚Äúroot‚Äù refers to the Duke‚Äôs lineage.
    ‚Ä¢ Silvanus‚Äôs Omen: A stag with antlers shaped like leafless trees watches the party. If followed, it vanishes, leaving a trampled circle of snow‚Äîa hex, or a blessing?
    ‚Ä¢ Offering: Leaving a silver coin or a lock of hair grants advantage on the next Survival check.
5. Return to Okton
    ‚Ä¢ Success: The village butcher, Hagan, renders fat for candles and tans hides. Children savor marrow broth. Ser Mardo nods approval‚Äîa rare gesture.
    ‚Ä¢ Failure: Villagers eye the party with resentment. Maera brews nettle tea to dull hunger pangs, muttering, ‚ÄúThe forest owes us a debt.‚Äù
    ‚Ä¢ Grey Hunger Foreshadowing: Griphis examines a deer carcass, noting the stag‚Äôs blackened tongue.
    
Expanded Narrative Hooks
    ‚Ä¢ Ralf‚Äôs Lesson: During the hunt, Ralf recounts how his grandfather survived the Famine of 1360 by trading fey-stolen grain. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll help ya, but always name your price clear.‚Äù

## ü¶å **Scene 3: The Hunt & Wolf Ambush**

### ü¶å **Part 1: A Herd in the Hollow** *(Expanded)*

**Purpose:** Build tension through careful stalking and reward successful hunting skills.

**Narrative Beats:**
- Dawn breaks cold and clear. The party moves toward a known feeding ground‚Äîa sheltered hollow where deer often gather.
- As they crest a ridge, they spot 4-6 deer grazing on lichen near a frozen stream. Among them, Ralf spots a promising stag.
- He whispers, "That one there‚Äîsee the rack? That's a hart of ten. In better times, only lords'd be allowed to chase such a beast."
- The hollow is treacherous ground‚Äîfrozen stream, scattered boulders, and dense blackthorn thickets that could scatter the herd.

**Environmental Details:**
- Wind direction is crucial‚ÄîRalf teaches the party to move only when it masks their scent.
- Snowdrifts provide cover, but one wrong step could send a cascade of snow down.
- Frozen branches creak ominously in the cold.

**Hunting Mechanics:**
- **Stealth Check (DC 14)**: Success allows for positioning and a clean shot; failure sends the herd bolting.
- **Positioning Options**:
  - Flank the herd from the ridge (ranged advantage, but risky)
  - Circle through the blackthorn (disadvantage on stealth, but surprise)
  - Set a simple snare (trap DC 12, takes time but guarantees one deer)
- **Successful Kill**:
  - Aim for lungs or neck (instant kill)
  - Gut shots spoil the meat (lose 50% of value)
  - **Field Dressing (Survival DC 10)**: Prevents spoilage and allows for raw liver consumption (+1 temp HP, advantage on next Con save)

**Historical Flavor:**
- Ralf explains drive hunting techniques used by foresters: "You don't chase 'em‚Äîyou drive 'em. Make a wall of noise behind, funnel 'em toward the waiting spear."
- He warns about the hart's symbolism: "Killin' a noble beast in noble times'd get you in trouble. But these ain't noble times."

**Plague Foreshadowing:**
- One deer has a slight limp‚ÄîRalf notes it but says it's common in winter.
- The stag's breath seems unusually thick, almost smoky in the cold air.

### üê∫ **Part 2: Wolf Ambush**

**Purpose:** Introduce supernatural fear and high-stakes combat.

**Narrative Beats:**
- As the party begins processing their kills, a low growl echoes through the trees.
- From the shadows emerge 3-5 wolves‚Äîemaciated, ribs visible beneath mangy coats, eyes milky white like cataracts.
- Ralf's face darkens: "Devil's eyes. They ain't just hungry‚Äîthey're sick. Cursed."
- The wolves circle slowly, testing the party's resolve, targeting the weakest or most isolated member.

**Tactics & Symbolism:**
- Wolves are cunning‚Äîthey don't attack immediately, instead trying to scatter the party.
- If the party splits up, wolves will drag down stragglers.
- The milky eyes and diseased appearance reinforce medieval fears of wolves as harbingers of plague and damnation.

**Combat Mechanics:**
- **Wolf Behavior**: Pack tactics‚Äîflanking, targeting lowest HP character
- **Fear Factor**: First wolf attack imposes Disadvantage on first attack roll for each PC (unless they make a DC 12 Wis save)
- **Post-Battle Roll (1d6)**:
  - 1‚Äì3: Nearby prey flees (no additional encounters)
  - 4‚Äì6: A wounded boar charges the party (AC 13, 2d6+3 damage)

**Lore & Atmosphere:**
- During combat, the forest falls eerily silent‚Äîno birds, no wind, just the sounds of battle.
- After the fight, Ralf examines one wolf's corpse: "See the tongue? Black as ink. This ain't natural hunger."
- He warns the party to burn the wolf corpses or bury them deep‚Äîsuperstition says diseased wolves carry curses.

**Historical Context:**
- Ralf recalls wolf hunts from his youth: "Used to be, we'd drive 'em into pits. Now they're driving us."
- He mentions how wolves were blamed for everything from livestock deaths to crop failures to the Black Death itself.

### üèòÔ∏è **Scene 4: Return to Okton**

**Purpose:** Show consequences and set up future sessions.

**Narrative Beats:**
- If the party succeeds:
  - Villagers are grateful. Hagan the butcher processes the meat, children get marrow broth.
  - Ser Mardo nods in rare approval.
- If they fail:
  - Resentment grows. Maera mutters about the forest owing a debt.
  - Griphis examines the deer and notes the blackened tongue‚Äîan ominous sign.

**Mechanics:**
- **Town Reaction Roll (1d6)**:
  - 1‚Äì2: Gratitude and morale boost
  - 3‚Äì4: Mixed reaction, some suspicion
  - 5‚Äì6: Open hostility, whispers of incompetence or worse

**Flavor & Lore:**
- The blackened tongue hints at a deeper plague spreading through the forest.
- Ralf warns: "If the forest is sick, we're next."
- Children who tasted the marrow broth begin having strange dreams‚Äîof running through snow, of eyes watching from the trees.

---

## üß© **Optional Side Quests & Hooks**

- **The Diseased Deer**: One of the deer shows signs of illness. Tracking its origin could lead to a corrupted grove.
- **Wolf Den**: Following wolf tracks might reveal a den with clues about their strange behavior.
- **The Butcher's Concern**: Hagan notices something odd about the meat‚Äîtoo dark, wrong texture‚Äîand asks the party to investigate the source.

---

## üß† **GM Tips**

- Use the **deer hunt** to showcase different character skills and play styles
- Make the **wolf encounter** genuinely frightening through atmosphere and description
- Let **Ralf's knowledge** guide decisions without being overbearing
- Plant **plague seeds** subtly‚Äîblackened tongues, strange dreams, unusual behavior
- Consider having one wolf escape to create future tension
