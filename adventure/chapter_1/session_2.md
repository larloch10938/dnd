# The Long Night in The Hollow Oak
*An Historically-Grounded D&D Adventure*

## Setting Context

Okton is a small Alpine village of roughly 100 souls, nestled in the harsh mountains of the Border Kingdoms around 1372. Like the historical mountain communities of Piedmont and Savoy circa 1300, this settlement represents a precarious balance between human resilience and nature's formidable power. The village's economy centers not on extensive farming, but on animal husbandry (particularly transhumance - seasonal livestock movement) and forestry management, integrating them into broader regional trade networks despite their apparent isolation.

The village's position near vital mountain passes makes it strategically important, much like historical communities controlling Alpine routes. These passes serve as conduits for trade, pilgrimage, and external influences, transforming geographical obstacles into sources of both opportunity and danger.

## Opening Scene

The wind, a relentless beast from the northern wastes, howls outside the stout walls of The Hollow Oak. This tavern, built in the traditional Alpine style with stone foundations housing stables and workshops, and wooden upper floors where the family lives, represents the heart of community life. The building employs *Blockbau* construction - overlapping timber trunks with interlocking corners - typical of mountain architecture designed to withstand harsh winters.

Tonight's feast celebrates more than a successful hunt; it represents survival itself. In these mountain communities, where the growing season is short and arable land limited, such protein sources are vital for winter survival. The venison will be preserved through traditional methods: salting, smoking, and drying - techniques essential for maintaining food stores through the long, lean months ahead.

The villagers gathered here represent a tightly interdependent community where every individual's contribution is vital. Their faces, ruddy from heat and weak ale (safer than water and providing necessary calories), reflect both relief and the constant underlying anxiety of life on the edge.

## Character Interactions and Tasks

### **Greta and Dorn, the Tavernkeepers**
*Historical Context: Tavern-keepers were vital community figures, often serving as informal banks, news centers, and meeting places.*

**Enhanced Background:** Greta manages the tavern's complex operations - brewing the small beer that provides safe hydration, coordinating food storage and preservation, and maintaining the delicate social balance of the common room. Her missing cheese represents more than lost food; it's a matter of social honor and economic loss. In Alpine communities, aged cheeses like the one described were valuable trade commodities, often used as currency in mountain economies.

**The Missing Cheese Investigation:**
- **Historical Detail:** The "magical" smell (honey and ozone) suggests supernatural involvement, but historically, such losses were often attributed to clever animals, desperate neighbors, or actual theft during harsh winters.
- **The cheese itself:** A wheel of hard, golden cheese similar to historical Gruy√®re or Emmental, aged in cool cellars and worth several days' wages for a peasant.

#### **DM Resolution Outline:**
**True Culprit:** A desperate family (the Millards) with a sick child took the cheese, but local folklore about "faeries from the Glade" provides convenient misdirection.

**Investigation Paths:**
1. **Physical Evidence:** Careful examination reveals human footprints, not animal tracks
2. **Social Investigation:** The Millard family's youngest child has been ill with fever; they're too proud to ask for help
3. **Supernatural Red Herring:** Strange smell comes from Millard's wife burning medicinal herbs (bought from Maera) to treat the child

**Resolution Options:**
- **Diplomatic:** Convince the family to confess; arrange community support
- **Investigation:** Piece together clues to identify the real culprits
- **Supernatural:** Follow the faerie trail (red herring) leading to discovery of the real situation
- **Economic:** Arrange replacement or compensation through community resources

---

### **Ser Mardo of Izra, the Lord of the Manor**
*Historical Context: Local lords in mountain regions often had more collaborative relationships with peasants due to mutual dependence for survival.*

**Enhanced Background:** Ser Mardo represents the practical nobility of the Border Kingdoms - a man who understands that his survival depends on his people's prosperity. His concern about the palisade reflects real medieval priorities: fortifications were essential, but required skilled labor and community cooperation. The "Battle of Izra" has left him with both experience and trauma, making him value preparation and community defense.

**The Palisade Project:**
- **Historical Context:** Medieval palisades used local timber, requiring coordination between woodsmen, carpenters, and laborers. The work needed completion before ground froze.
- **Materials:** Local oak and pine, cut according to sustainable forestry practices
- **Labor:** Requires organizing villagers with different skills and motivations

#### **DM Resolution Outline:**
**The Challenge:** Limited time (approaching winter), competing labor needs (harvest preservation, animal shelter preparation), and potential material shortfalls.

**Resolution Mechanics:**
- **Resource Management:** Track timber, nails, labor hours
- **Skill Challenges:** Organization (Ser Mardo), technical knowledge (local carpenter), physical labor (community)
- **Complications:** Weather delays, tool breakage, competing priorities

**The Archery Training:**
- **Historical Context:** Longbow training was essential for mountain defense; skilled archers were valuable community assets
- **Ser Mardo's manor:** Stone-built with practice yards, reflecting his military background

#### **DM Resolution for Archery Training:**
**The Test:** Progressive difficulty shooting at various distances and conditions
1. Standard targets at 50, 100, 150 yards
2. Moving targets (rolling wheels)
3. Adverse conditions (wind, dim light)
4. Combat simulation (multiple targets, time pressure)

**Rewards:** Access to better equipment, tactical knowledge, increased reputation in community

### **Ralf, the Hunting Leader**
*Historical Context: Hunting leaders in mountain communities were essential figures, managing both subsistence hunting and protection from predators.*

**Enhanced Background:** Ralf represents the traditional woodcraft knowledge essential for mountain survival. His broken yew longbow is more than equipment failure - it's loss of a tool requiring specific materials and skilled craftsmanship. In historical Alpine communities, such specialists were highly valued for their knowledge of forest resources and animal behavior.

**The Yew Tree Quest:**
- **Historical Detail:** Yew trees suitable for longbows required specific characteristics - slow growth, dense grain, proper age
- **Location:** Deep forest areas where shadows lie thickest suggests old-growth forest, potentially sacred or dangerous areas
- **Craftsmanship:** Proper bow-making requires seasoning, careful selection of wood grain, and traditional techniques

#### **DM Resolution Outline:**
**The Perfect Tree:** Located in the "Shadowvale Grove," an area avoided by locals due to superstition (actually an old sacred site with lingering druidic influence).

**Challenges:**
1. **Navigation:** Finding the grove requires woodcraft skills and local knowledge
2. **Selection:** Identifying the right tree requires specialized knowledge
3. **Supernatural:** The grove is protected by a nature spirit (dryad or awakened tree)
4. **Practical:** Proper felling, transport, and initial preparation

**Resolution Paths:**
- **Respectful Approach:** Negotiate with grove guardian, offer appropriate tribute
- **Forceful Approach:** Overcome supernatural defenses, risk cursing the bow
- **Knowledge-Based:** Use druidic or ranger knowledge to properly approach sacred site
- **Community Approach:** Involve Griphis (cleric) to sanctify the harvest

**The Escaped Pigs:**
- **Historical Context:** Pigs in medieval mountain communities often foraged semi-wild in forests (pannage rights), but losing breeding stock was catastrophic

#### **DM Resolution for Pig Recovery:**
**The Trail:** Leads toward known wolf territory, creating time pressure
**Challenges:**
1. **Tracking:** Following pig signs through forest terrain
2. **Predators:** Wolves have already found the pigs; some casualties inevitable
3. **Terrain:** Rocky, steep areas where pigs sought shelter
4. **Weather:** Approaching storm threatens to eliminate tracks

**Encounter Design:**
- **Wolf Pack:** 4-6 wolves, protecting their kill
- **Pig Survivors:** 3-4 pigs recoverable if players act quickly
- **Environmental:** Cliff areas, thick underbrush, potential for getting lost

---

### **Maera the Midwife**
*Historical Context: Village wise women served as healthcare providers, spiritual advisors, and keepers of traditional knowledge. They often navigated complex relationships between Christian and pre-Christian beliefs.*

**Enhanced Background:** Maera represents the complex spiritual landscape of medieval mountain communities, where Christian and pre-Christian beliefs intermingled. Her concern about "witches" actually masks her own devotion to Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain - representing the historical reality that supposed witch-hunters were often practitioners themselves. Her knowledge of "twisted knots of hair and bone-charms" comes from personal experience.

**The Faerie Glade Investigation:**
- **Historical Context:** Remote natural areas often became centers for both beneficial and harmful magical practices
- **The Signs:** Nightmares, livestock born with defects, found charms suggest either genuine harmful magic or Maera's own manipulations

#### **DM Resolution Outline:**
**The Truth:** Maera is eliminating a rival coven of Shar-worshippers while deflecting suspicion from her own Loviatar practices.

**The Faerie Glade:** An ancient sacred site where multiple spiritual forces intersect
- **Shar Cultists:** 3-4 desperate women using pain magic to try controlling winter weather
- **Evidence:** Bone charms, ritual circles, obviously harmful magic
- **Maera's Manipulation:** She's been planting additional "evidence" to ensure PC action

**Complex Resolution:**
1. **Surface Level:** Eliminate obvious Shar cultists (what Maera wants)
2. **Investigation:** Discover Maera's involvement and true motivations
3. **Spiritual:** Cleanse the glade of all harmful influences
4. **Political:** Navigate village consequences of exposing the midwife

**Consequences:**
- **Success (Surface):** Village grateful, but Maera gains power
- **Success (Complete):** True spiritual cleansing, but community healthcare crisis
- **Failure:** Harmful magic continues, worse winter ahead

---

### **Griphis, the Cleric of Silvanus**
*Historical Context: Rural clergy often struggled with limited resources while maintaining both Christian duties and accommodation of local traditions.*

**Enhanced Background:** Griphis represents the reality of rural medieval clergy - often the sole literate person, serving multiple roles while battling his own limitations. His leprosy (historically common and devastating) affects his ability to perform essential community functions. His ceremony combines Christian elements with older forest traditions, reflecting the syncretic nature of medieval mountain spirituality.

**The Ceremony Components:**
- **Blood-leaf and Silver-moss:** Rare plants growing on dangerous cliff faces
- **Fresh mistletoe:** From the oldest oak, requiring forest navigation and tree-climbing
- **Sacred significance:** Maintaining the balance between community and forest

#### **DM Resolution Outline:**
**Raven's Crag:** A treacherous cliff face requiring climbing skills and environmental hazards
- **Hazards:** Wind, loose rock, predatory birds nesting in area
- **Plants:** Blood-leaf (used for wound treatment) and Silver-moss (preservative properties)
- **Guardian:** A giant eagle considers the cliff its territory

**The Oldest Oak:** Deep in the forest, this ancient tree is a natural druidic site
- **Location:** Requires navigation and forest lore
- **Mistletoe Harvest:** Climbing tall tree, proper ritual cutting
- **Guardians:** Woodland creatures, possibly awakened animals or dryads

**The Ceremony:**
- **Preparation:** Proper preservation and preparation of components
- **Performance:** Combining Christian prayers with forest traditions
- **Community Impact:** Successful ceremony provides tangible benefits (better hunting, favorable weather)
- **Griphis's Condition:** Physical strain may worsen his leprosy, requiring players to assist

**Benefits of Success:**
- **Mechanical:** Village gains temporary luck bonuses for winter survival
- **Story:** Improved community morale and forest harmony
- **Personal:** Griphis's faith strengthened, possible divine healing
- **Political:** Reinforces the balance between Christianity and older traditions

# The Long Night in The Hollow Oak
*An Historically-Grounded D&D Adventure*

---

## **READ ALOUD: Opening Scene for Players**

*"The wind screams across the peaks like a banshee's wail, battering the stout walls of The Hollow Oak with fists of ice and snow. But here, within these ancient timber walls, warmth pushes back against the darkness. The great hearth crackles and spits, casting dancing shadows that make the wolf pelts hanging from the smoke-blackened rafters seem to twitch with phantom life.*

*The air is thick with the rich aroma of roasting venison‚Äîthe prize of your recent hunt‚Äîmingled with peat smoke, damp wool, and the faint, malty scent of Greta's small beer. Nearly a hundred souls crowd into this tavern tonight, their faces ruddy from heat and ale, their eyes reflecting the flickering firelight. This isn't mere celebration; this is survival made manifest. The meat carved by Dorn's steady hand fills bellies that have known little more than thin pottage and hard bread for weeks.*

*As you settle in among the villagers of Okton, wooden mugs of weak but warming ale are pressed into your hands. The tavern itself seems to sigh with contentment‚Äîits stone foundations housing the stables below, its overlapping timber walls built to withstand winters that can kill the unprepared. Tonight, for the first time in weeks, this feels less like a desperate outpost clinging to the edge of civilization, and more like... home.*

*But as the night deepens and the ale loosens tongues, you notice something in the villagers' faces beyond gratitude. Relief, yes‚Äîbut also the weight of unfinished business, of problems that a single successful hunt cannot solve. One by one, as the feast continues, they will seek you out. Their bellies may be full tonight, but their minds remain burdened with the constant anxieties of life in these unforgiving mountains."*

---

## **For the DM: Managing the Evening's Flow**

Present these NPCs and their concerns organically throughout the feast. Start with Greta and Dorn immediately after the opening scene, then introduce others as the evening progresses and the players mingle. Each interaction should feel natural‚Äîa grateful villager approaching with a problem, not a quest-giver delivering exposition.

## Setting Context

Okton is a small Alpine village of roughly 100 souls, nestled in the harsh mountains of the Border Kingdoms around 1372. Like the historical mountain communities of Piedmont and Savoy circa 1300, this settlement represents a precarious balance between human resilience and nature's formidable power. The village's economy centers not on extensive farming, but on animal husbandry (particularly transhumance - seasonal livestock movement) and forestry management, integrating them into broader regional trade networks despite their apparent isolation.

## **NPC Introductions and Tasks**

### **1. Greta and Dorn, the Tavernkeepers** *(Approach immediately after opening)*

**READ ALOUD:**
*"As you settle into the warmth, a bustling woman with sharp, intelligent eyes approaches your table. She wipes flour-dusted hands on her apron, her face a mixture of genuine gratitude and barely contained worry. Behind her, a solidly built man with graying temples continues polishing a wooden mug with deliberate, methodical strokes‚Äîhis thoughtful gaze sweeping over the crowded room like a shepherd watching his flock.*

*'Heroes!' the woman says, her voice carrying over the din. 'I'm Greta, and that's my husband Dorn there. You've filled every belly in Okton tonight‚Äîa finer hunt I've not seen in years!' Her smile falters slightly. 'But... well, the celebration isn't what it should be. Not complete, if you understand my meaning.'"*

**When players engage:**

### **Greta and Dorn, the Tavernkeepers**
**When players engage:**

*"Greta leans in closer, lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper. 'It's the cheese, you see. A wheel of hard, golden cheese‚Äîsweet as mountain nuts and sharp as a winter wind. A gift from a southern merchant, aged for two full seasons. I was saving it special for Ser Mardo, for this very night. A matter of honor, showing proper respect to our lord.'*

*She wrings her hands anxiously. 'But it's gone. Vanished from our larder like morning mist! The door was latched tight‚ÄîI checked it myself before the feast began. And there's this... smell where it was. Sweet, but strange. Like honey mixed with the air before a thunderstorm.'*

*Dorn looks up from his endless polishing, shaking his head slowly. 'The missus thinks it's the faeries from the Glade, punishing her for some imagined slight. More like a fox grew clever, I say, or perhaps young Timmet got too bold with his hunger.'*

*Greta scoffs. 'A fox doesn't latch a door behind itself, husband! And no mere beast leaves such an otherworldly scent. Please, heroes‚Äîyour skills brought meat to our table tonight. Could they not also bring honor back to our house? Find my cheese before the night is done, so I might present it to Ser Mardo as intended. The reputation of The Hollow Oak depends on it.'"*

---

### **2. Ser Mardo of Izra, the Lord of the Manor** *(Introduce after 30-45 minutes of gameplay)*

**READ ALOUD:**
*"Seated near the great hearth, slightly apart from the common folk, sits a man whose bearing speaks of authority tempered by hard experience. His weathered hands move slowly as he eats, his gaze distant‚Äîas if seeing ghosts from old battles dancing in the flames. Despite his obvious status, there's nothing soft about him; his clothes are practical, well-made but not ostentatious, and his sword rests within easy reach. When he notices your attention, he raises his wooden mug in your direction‚Äîa silent acknowledgment that speaks louder than words."*

**When players approach:**

*"Ser Mardo sets down his mug and regards you with eyes that have seen both victory and loss. 'Your skill honors this village,' he says, his voice carrying the authority of command softened by genuine gratitude. 'Such a hunt reminds us that the forest provides... but it also reminds us of our vulnerability. The wolves grow bold when winter deepens, and the whispers from BlackSaddle to the north speak not of peace, but of preparation for war.'*

*He gestures toward the village outside, where wind rattles shutters and snow builds against walls. 'Our palisade is weak‚Äîrot and winter have taken their toll on timber that should protect us. We have the wood, cut and ready, but not enough skilled hands to raise a proper defensive wall before the deep frost makes the ground impossible to work. A man-at-arms is worth little without a wall to stand behind.'*

*His gaze shifts to your weapons, particularly any bows among your gear. 'Your skill with blade and bow is evident. But skill without practice grows dull as neglected iron. My manor has an armory‚Äîsparse, but serviceable‚Äîand a training yard where a warrior might test their true measure. After you've rested from tonight's labors, I would have you join me there. An archer who does not practice is no better than a farmer with a sharp stick, and these mountains have need of true marksmen.'"*

---

### **3. Ralf, the Hunting Leader** *(Introduce when players are well into their cups)*

**READ ALOUD:**
*"A gruff, barrel-chested man with hands like gnarled oak roots holds court at a table surrounded by younger woodsmen. His voice, roughened by years of calling through forest mist, carries over the tavern's din as he regales his audience with embellished tales of the hunt. When he spots you, his weathered face breaks into a gap-toothed grin, and he slaps the table hard enough to make mugs jump.*

*'There they are!' he bellows. 'Told you lads they had the right stuff! Not like some I could mention who couldn't track a bleeding boar through fresh snow.' He takes a long pull from his mug, then his expression grows more serious as he holds up a magnificent yew longbow‚Äîor what was once magnificent."*

**When players engage:**

*"Ralf runs his thumb along a fresh crack near the bow's grip, his pride evident even in disappointment. 'This old friend finally gave up the ghost today. Snapped on the final shot‚Äîfelt her go just as your arrow found its mark. Can't trust her now, and a man in these mountains without a proper bow might as well cut his own throat and save the wolves the trouble.'*

*He leans forward, lowering his voice. 'Good yew is harder to find than an honest tax collector, but I know of a tree‚Äîancient thing, growing where the shadows lie thickest in the deep wood. The kind of wood that sings when you draw it, that sends an arrow true even in a gale. But I'd need skilled hands to help me fell it proper, and eyes sharp enough to carve it right.'*

*Suddenly, a young, panicked-looking farmer bursts through the tavern door, snow swirling around him as he stumbles toward Ralf's table. After a hurried, whispered conversation, Ralf's face darkens like a thundercloud.*

*'Curse that boy's careless hide!' he snarls, turning back to you. 'Young Perrin left the breeding pen unlatched‚Äîhalf a dozen of my best pigs are loose in the woods. If the wolves find them before we do, we'll be gnawing boot leather come spring. I need trackers, and I need them now. We can follow their trail if we move quickly, before the next snowfall covers their tracks.'"*

---

### **4. Maera the Midwife** *(Introduce during a quieter moment, when the revelry has died down somewhat)*

**READ ALOUD:**
*"In a quieter corner of the tavern, an older woman sits with the village's matrons, her weathered hands never still as she mends a small tunic by firelight. Her presence seems to emanate a comforting warmth‚Äîthe kind of person you instinctively trust with your deepest hurts. But when she catches your eye, there's something unsettling in her gaze. She waits until the nearby conversations have moved on, then beckons you closer with a subtle gesture."*

**When players approach:**

*"Maera's voice is barely above a whisper, her words chosen carefully. 'You have the forest's blessing tonight,' she says, studying your faces with unsettling intensity. 'But blessings can turn to curses when the balance is disturbed. The forest... it has moods, and lately, those moods have grown dark.'*

*She sets aside her mending, leaning closer. 'Strange things stir in the Faerie Glade. Old things. Angry things. The children wake screaming from dreams of laughter that cuts like broken glass. Last week, Willem's cow birthed a calf with its eyes turned inward, white and blind. These are not good signs.'*

*Her voice drops even lower, forcing you to strain to hear. 'Some say it is witches‚Äîwomen who meet in the cold darkness, drawing power from pain and suffering. They leave their marks: twisted knots of hair, charms made from bone and bitter herbs, arranged in patterns that hurt to look upon. They poison the very air around the Glade, turning the old spirits against us.'*

*She reaches out, her fingers briefly touching your wrist with surprising strength. 'Griphis tries, bless him, but his prayers to Silvanus grow weaker as his body fails. Someone with true strength must face this darkness before it spreads. Go to the Glade. See for yourself what festers there. But beware‚Äîwhat you find may not be some simple crone with herb-knowledge and grudges. Some evils run deeper than that.'"*

---

### **5. Griphis, the Cleric of Silvanus** *(Introduce near the end of the evening, as the crowd begins to thin)*

**READ ALOUD:**
*"At a small table tucked away from the main celebration, a thin man in simple robes sips his ale with careful, measured movements. Leather wrappings cover his hands and forearms, but they cannot completely hide the telltale signs of his affliction‚Äîthe waxy pallor, the slightly sunken features. Despite his obvious illness, his eyes burn with quiet faith, and when he smiles at your approach, there's genuine warmth in the expression."*

**When players engage:**

*"'Silvanus has blessed us tonight through your hands,' Griphis says, his voice raspy but sincere. 'A successful hunt is a prayer answered, proof that the Oak Father still watches over his children.' He pauses to take a careful sip of ale, grimacing slightly at what must be pain.*

*'But the forest gives, and the forest demands. A gift requires a gift in return, lest the balance be disturbed and future hunts fail.' He shifts in his seat, favoring what appears to be a stiffened leg. 'I must prepare a Ceremony of Thanks at the sacred shrine. We will offer the antlers of the great stag and burn sacred herbs, sending their smoke to appease the forest spirits and ensure continued bounty.'*

*His expression grows troubled. 'But my strength... it fails me more each day. The herbs I need‚ÄîBlood-leaf and Silver-moss‚Äîthey grow only on the face of Raven's Crag, where the wind cuts like a blade and one misstep means a fall to certain death. And the ceremony requires fresh mistletoe, cut from the oldest oak deep in the heart of the wood.'*

*He looks up at you with hopeful, desperate eyes. 'Would you aid me in this sacred task? Your participation would show the village that even mighty hunters respect the spirits of wood and stone. It would bring them great comfort... and perhaps ensure that the forest's favor continues when next you have need of it.'"*

**The Faerie Glade:** An ancient sacred site where multiple spiritual forces intersect
- **Shar Cultists:** 3-4 desperate women using pain magic to try controlling winter weather
- **Evidence:** Bone charms, ritual circles, obviously harmful magic
- **Maera's Manipulation:** She's been planting additional "evidence" to ensure PC action

**Complex Resolution:**
1. **Surface Level:** Eliminate obvious Shar cultists (what Maera wants)
2. **Investigation:** Discover Maera's involvement and true motivations
3. **Spiritual:** Cleanse the glade of all harmful influences
4. **Political:** Navigate village consequences of exposing the midwife

**Consequences:**
- **Success (Surface):** Village grateful, but Maera gains power
- **Success (Complete):** True spiritual cleansing, but community healthcare crisis
- **Failure:** Harmful magic continues, worse winter ahead

### **Griphis, the Cleric of Silvanus**
*Historical Context: Rural clergy often struggled with limited resources while maintaining both Christian duties and accommodation of local traditions.*

**Enhanced Background:** Griphis represents the reality of rural medieval clergy - often the sole literate person, serving multiple roles while battling his own limitations. His leprosy (historically common and devastating) affects his ability to perform essential community functions. His ceremony combines Christian elements with older forest traditions, reflecting the syncretic nature of medieval mountain spirituality.

**The Ceremony Components:**
- **Blood-leaf and Silver-moss:** Rare plants growing on dangerous cliff faces
- **Fresh mistletoe:** From the oldest oak, requiring forest navigation and tree-climbing
- **Sacred significance:** Maintaining the balance between community and forest

#### **DM Resolution Outline:**
**Raven's Crag:** A treacherous cliff face requiring climbing skills and environmental hazards
- **Hazards:** Wind, loose rock, predatory birds nesting in area
- **Plants:** Blood-leaf (used for wound treatment) and Silver-moss (preservative properties)
- **Guardian:** A giant eagle considers the cliff its territory

**The Oldest Oak:** Deep in the forest, this ancient tree is a natural druidic site
- **Location:** Requires navigation and forest lore
- **Mistletoe Harvest:** Climbing tall tree, proper ritual cutting
- **Guardians:** Woodland creatures, possibly awakened animals or dryads

**The Ceremony:**
- **Preparation:** Proper preservation and preparation of components
- **Performance:** Combining Christian prayers with forest traditions
- **Community Impact:** Successful ceremony provides tangible benefits (better hunting, favorable weather)
- **Griphis's Condition:** Physical strain may worsen his leprosy, requiring players to assist

**Benefits of Success:**
- **Mechanical:** Village gains temporary luck bonuses for winter survival
- **Story:** Improved community morale and forest harmony
