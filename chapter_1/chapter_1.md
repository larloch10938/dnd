B1.1 – A Hunt

The dawn breaks over Okton like a cracked bone, pale and brittle. The village huddles beneath a sky the color of tarnished iron, its cottages buried to the eaves in snowdrifts that whisper of a winter with no end. Smoke curls from chimneys, thin and desperate, as if even the hearths know the fuel is running low. You gather at the edge of the forest, breath steaming in the air, fingers stiff around bowstrings and spear hafts. Ralf stands before you, his face a map of old scars and older grudges. The hunting leader’s voice rasps like a saw through frostbitten wood:

“Listen well—this ain’t some boy’s game of hide-and-seek. Out there?” He jerks a thumb toward the trees, skeletal and groaning under their burden of ice. “That’s the Duke’s forest. Now it’s hungry. Wolves with bellies full of naught but pine needles. Deer so lean you’ll be carving shadows. And worse things… things that don’t leave tracks.”

He spits into the snow, the globule freezing before it hits the ground. “You bag three deer—three—or we’re boiling boot leather by week’s end. Fail, and the young’uns’ll be sucking on icicles for supper. Succeed?” His one good eye glints. “Might just live long enough to see the Duke’s taxmen bleed us dry anyway.”

The wind howls through the village, carrying the stench of damp ash and the distant yowl of a wolf. Somewhere behind you, a child coughs—a wet, rattling sound that doesn’t stop. Maera the midwife kneels in the snow, grinding frostbitten herbs into a poultice. She catches your eye and shakes her head, as if to say, “Don’t linger.”

Ralf thrusts a bundle of arrows into your hands. The fletchings are frayed, the tips dull. “Silvanus’s grace be with you,” mutters Griphis, the leper-priest, from the shadow of his shrine. His bandaged hands tremble as he lights a votive candle—a feeble spark in the gloom. The flame gutters, casting twisted shapes across the snow. For a heartbeat, they look like antlers. Or claws.

The forest waits. Its silence is a living thing, thick and suffocating. No birds sing. No squirrels scratch at the bark. Even the wind dies at the tree line, as if the snow itself is holding its breath. Somewhere in that white waste, a stag watches. A wolf prowls. A shadow stirs. And beneath it all, faint as a dying man’s pulse, the forest thrums with something older than hunger, older than kings…

Ralf cinches his fur-lined cloak tighter. “Move quiet. Move smart. And if you see lights that don’t burn, or hear words that ain’t yours… run.”

The village shrinks behind you. The cold gnaws at your lungs. Somewhere ahead, a branch snaps. Something screams—a fox, maybe. Or not. You nock an arrow, grip a spear, and step into the teeth of winter.

Overview
The winter of 1402 grips Okton in a vise of unrelenting cold. The villagers’ larders, already lean after a poor harvest, are nearly empty. Frost clings to the thatched roofs like a parasite, and the hearths burn low. Ralf, the grizzled hunting leader, gathers the party at dawn. His breath hangs in the air as he barks orders: “We’ll take the old game trail to Blackpine Ridge. Move quiet, or we’ll starve by Equinox.” The forest, a skeletal expanse of oak and pine, offers little mercy. Yet within its depths lies salvation—meat, fur, and a fleeting chance to outlast the Duke’s failing reign.
Historical Context
Medieval winters were existential threats. Villagers like Okton’s relied on communal hunts, preserving every scrap of fat and sinew. Bows were prized, but traps and snares were equally vital. Wolves, driven by hunger, stalked closer to settlements, while folklore warned of fey spirits punishing those who hunted without respect. The “Grey Hunger” parallels historical plagues, where inexplicable illnesses were often blamed on miasma or divine wrath.

Key Objectives
    1. Secure Fresh Game – The party must bag at least three deer or a boar to feed Okton’s 80 souls. Failure means rationing bark-bread and boiled leather.
    2. Survive the Forest – Beyond wolves and cold, the woods hide ice-covered ravines and fey traps. Superstition dictates offerings of bread or coin at shrines to Silvanus.
    3. Glimpse of Darkness – A slain stag’s blackened tongue or wolf packs with milky eyes hint at the plague’s reach.

Encounters & Challenges
1. Harsh Winter Conditions
    • Tracking (Survival/DC 12): The snow reveals deer slots (hoofprints) and tufts of fur on hawthorn bushes. However, a sudden snowfall (1d4 hours in) obscures trails, raising the DC to 14.
    • Cold’s Toll (Constitution Save/DC 10): Woolen cloaks and tallow-coated boots delay hypothermia, but prolonged exposure numbs fingers. Failures impose disadvantage on ranged attacks.
    • Historical Detail: Ralf teaches the party to stuff moss into their boots for insulation and chew pine needles to stave off thirst.
2. Wolf Ambush
    • Tactics: The wolves (3–5) are emaciated, ribs visible beneath mangy coats. They circle the party, targeting the smallest or weakest-looking member. If the party scatters, wolves drag down stragglers.
    • Noise Factor: Combat shouts echo through the forest. Roll a d6 post-battle: 1–3 = prey within 1 mile flees; 4–6 = a wounded boar charges the party (AC 13, 2d6+3 damage).
3. The Prey
    • A Herd in the Hollow: The party spots 4–6 deer grazing on lichen near a frozen stream. Ralf whispers, “Aim for the lungs. A gutshot’ll spoil the meat.”
    • Stealth/DC 14: Crouch behind snowdrifts and move only when the wind masks footfalls. Failure sends the herd bolting into a thicket of blackthorn bushes (1d4 slashing damage per 10 feet pursued).
    • Historical Detail: Successful kills require field dressing (Survival/DC 10) to avoid tainting the meat. The liver, rich in iron, is eaten raw by hunters to replenish strength.
4. Faerie Encounter (Optional)
    • Dancing Lights: On the return trek, will-o’-wisps flicker near a moss-coated menhir. A voice, like wind through reeds, whispers, “Il respiro del Ducato si affievolisce”
    • Arcana/DC 13: The fey speak in riddles, but their warning aligns with the Duke’s illness. A successful check reveals the “root” refers to the Duke’s lineage.
    • Silvanus’s Omen: A stag with antlers shaped like leafless trees watches the party. If followed, it vanishes, leaving a trampled circle of snow—a hex, or a blessing?
    • Offering: Leaving a silver coin or a lock of hair grants advantage on the next Survival check.
5. Return to Okton
    • Success: The village butcher, Hagan, renders fat for candles and tans hides. Children savor marrow broth. Ser Mardo nods approval—a rare gesture.
    • Failure: Villagers eye the party with resentment. Maera brews nettle tea to dull hunger pangs, muttering, “The forest owes us a debt.”
    • Grey Hunger Foreshadowing: Griphis examines a deer carcass, noting the stag’s blackened tongue.
    
Expanded Narrative Hooks
    • Ralf’s Lesson: During the hunt, Ralf recounts how his grandfather survived the Famine of 1360 by trading fey-stolen grain. “They’ll help ya, but always name your price clear.”

B1.2 – Introduction: Life in Okton
Setting & Atmosphere
Okton is a modest village in the Duchy of Chasir-Asak, nestled at the edge of dense woodlands near Elkwood. Roughly 80–100 souls call it home, scraping by on hunting, woodcutting, and small-scale farming. The single muddy road is lined with timber-framed cottages, patched with whatever materials the villagers can find. Snowdrifts and a biting wind mark the harsh reality of winter in these Border Kingdoms.
    1. Ser Mardo’s Manor
        ○ A small stone structure on a hill, ringed by a wooden palisade.
        ○ Ser Mardo, a knight and the lone survivor of the Battle of Izra, keeps a sparse armory here.
        ○ Old banners and a single longsword above the hearth recall his tragic past.
        ○ The armory holds six rusted bills and a chainmail hauberk looted from Izra, its links still stained with salt (from tears or sea-blood, none dare ask).
        ○ A manor court convenes monthly. Ser Mardo adjudicates disputes using trial by oath—peasants swear on Silvanus’s shrine, knights on their swords.
        ○ The manor’s granary is half-empty; Mardo’s feudal duty to store emergency grain clashes with the Duke’s rising taxes.
    2. The Hollow Oak
        ○ Structure: A 14th-century expansion grafted onto a 9th-century oak, its hollow core blackened by centuries of hearth-smoke. The ceiling is low, forcing patrons to stoop—a reminder of their place.
        ○ Historical Context: Taverns doubled as courtrooms and gossip mills in medieval villages. Greta’s "nosy" nature mirrors the ale-wife’s role as keeper of secrets and matchmaker.
        ○ Serves small beer (weak, boiled to avoid dysentery) and pease pottage studded with scraps of salt pork.
        ○ A merchet (marriage tax) ledger sits under the counter—Ser Mardo takes 10% of dowries.
        ○ The hearth’s soot holds warding sigils scratched by Maera; villagers believe they repel faeries.
        ○ The village’s only tavern, built partly into an ancient hollowed oak.
        ○ Run by Greta (nosy, gossip-loving) and Dorn (quiet, thoughtful).
        ○ Faint music and the smell of weak ale welcome travelers.
    3. Ralf’s Hunting Lodge
        ○ Structure: A 13th-century longhouse, its roof sagging under moss and snow. Wolf pelts hang from rafters, curing over a peat fire.
        ○ Historical Context: Medieval hunting was class-regulated. While nobles chased stag, peasants trapped hare and poached at their peril. Ralf’s lodge exists by Ser Mardo’s sufferance—and a 20% tithe of all game.
        ○ A yew longbow hangs above the door, its string frayed. Yew was reserved for military archers by royal decree, but borderlands ignore such laws.
        ○ Maps show poacher’s marks—symbols for wolf dens, game trails, and the Duke’s foresters’ patrol routes.
        ○ Ralf’s “training” mirrors the yeoman’s duty to practice archery weekly, as decreed by the Assize of Arms (1252).
    4. The Faerie Glade
        ○ A ring of ancient oaks just outside the village.
        ○ Known for mysterious mushrooms and eerie lights after dark.
        ○ Children’s tales warn of villagers vanishing if they linger too long.
    5. Chapel of Silvanus
        ○ A modest stone shrine dedicated to the God of the Forest.
        ○ Maintained by the village healer, Griphis, who also dispenses herbal remedies.

Key NPCs
    1. Ser Mardo of Izra
        ○ Role: Lord of Okton’s manor, haunted veteran.
        ○ Personality: Stoic, melancholic, yet fiercely protective.

    2. Ralf, the Hunting Leader
        ○ Role: Veteran woodsman, mentor to young hunters (including the PCs).
        ○ Personality: Gruff, proud, and unyielding in his training methods.
        ○ Notes: Wants Okton’s youth to be prepared for the brutal world beyond the village.
    3. Griphis, the cleric of Silvanus
        ○ He is a leper
        ○ Roleplay Beat: His poultices use woad and honey—effective for wounds, useless against the Grey Hunger.
    4. Maera the Midwife
        ○ Role: Healer, herbalist, and unofficial spiritual guide.
        ○ Personality: Warm but no-nonsense; possibly a touch of real magic in her craft.
        ○ Notes: Warns against disturbing faerie circles and old forest spirits.
        ○ She is secretly a worshipper of Lovaiatar and will kill Griphis.

B1.3 – Military Parade
Overview
Shortly after the hunt, the characters experience a flashback or brief interlude showing them (and the entire region) the full might of the Duchy of Chasir-Asak. This parade unfolds at a nearby fortress—often referred to as Olegton or another suitable keep—and is intended to rally commoners and display the Duke’s strength.
Key Elements
    1. The Duke’s Procession
        ○ A majestic display of knights, banners, and courtiers.
        ○ Dwarven representatives from an expedition against the “Breath of Shar” (the Grey Hunger) are present, foreshadowing the plague.
    2. High-Level NPC Introductions
        ○ The Duke himself, riding at the parade’s forefront.
        ○ The High-Level Party (from campaign section A1) is glimpsed, a reminder of how far the PCs still have to go.
        ○ Key figures such as Lord John Khaven and Countess Andras’s representatives might address the crowd.
    3. Player Perspective
        ○ As low-born villagers, the PCs watch from the sidelines, starry-eyed at the pomp and ceremony.
        ○ A brief chance to interact with or overhear vital NPCs—perhaps the Duke’s offhand comment about growing illness or tensions with Emyrs.
Suggested Scenes
    1. Arrival at Olegton
        ○ A bustle of merchants, soldiers, and townsfolk crowd the streets.
        ○ The party might do errands or gather rumors: Investigation/DC 13 or Persuasion/DC 15 with locals.
    2. The Parade
        ○ Knights in polished armor, heraldic flags, and drumbeats echoing off stone walls.
        ○ Skill Checks: PCs might attempt to catch a glimpse or win favor with a passing knight (Performance or Persuasion/DC ~15).
    3. Foreshadowing the Duke’s Illness
        ○ Observant PCs (Medicine/DC 13 or Insight/DC 14) might notice the Duke looking pale or fatigued, alluding to the “Grey Hunger.”
    4. Return to Okton (Flashback Ends)
        ○ The spectacle is over; the PCs are left with both inspiration and a lingering sense of dread.
    End of B1.3: The parade underscores the height of the Duke’s power before calamity strikes, firmly planting the seeds for his imminent downfall.

B1.4 – Death of the Duke: The Grey Hunger
Overview
A herald arrives in Okton with dire news: the Duke of Chasir-Asak has died from an unknown plague called the “Grey Hunger.” His death sends shockwaves through the duchy, intensifying instability and fear.
Key Events
    1. Spreading Illness
        ○ Local villagers exhibit symptoms: pallid skin, fatigue, madness.
        ○ Maera and the PCs scramble to find remedies; none prove truly effective.
    2. The Herald’s Announcement
        ○ A messenger clad in the Duke’s colors calls for unity, but reveals that noble houses are already vying for succession.
        ○ Tension: Will the Countess Andras maintain control? Will Emyrs capitalize on the chaos?
    3. Personal Impact
        ○ Loved ones or important villagers could fall ill, prompting the PCs to explore possible cures or superstitious rituals.
        ○ Ser Mardo demands the village remain calm but privately prepares for worst-case scenarios.
    4. Rumors & Investigations
        ○ Some say it’s a faerie curse.
        ○ Others claim it’s an alchemical weapon from Emyrs.
        ○ Dark whispers suggest the Duke himself dabbled in forbidden magic.
    5. Consequences
        ○ Fear and paranoia rise; mobs might accuse neighbors of witchcraft.
        ○ Recruitment for the duchy’s defense ramps up, accelerating the PCs’ path to soldiering.
    End of B1.4: With the Duke gone and the plague spreading, the duchy’s leadership is in disarray. The PCs see firsthand that war may be coming sooner rather than later.

B1.5 – Training & Rallying Troops
Overview
In the wake of the Duke’s death, Ser Mardo tasks the PCs with recruiting and training new soldiers from the barony of Elkwood. This segment emphasizes diplomacy, strategy, and moral choices—testing the party’s growing influence.
Key Objectives
    1. Raise an Army – The PCs must gather able-bodied villagers and convince reluctant nobles.
    2. Balance Morale & Resources – Food is scarce, and the “Grey Hunger” complicates matters.
    3. Command at a Low Level – The party steps into leadership roles, learning the burdens of responsibility.
Mechanics: A Mini-Game of Recruitment
    • Recruitment Points (RP): Each success in diplomatic or skill-based tasks contributes to a total (e.g., needing 50 RP for a strong fighting force).
    • Time Constraint: 5 in-game days before they must depart for Drelev.
    1. Convince Nobles (e.g., Lady Kira of Elkwood)
        ○ Persuasion/DC 15–20: Success yields 10–15 RP; failure costs 5 RP as she sows doubt.
    2. Inspire Commoners
        ○ Performance or Religion/DC 12–18: Stir their hearts, gain 5–10 RP.
    3. Rally the Woodsmen (with Ralf’s help)
        ○ Survival or Nature/DC 15–18: Demonstrate skill to earn respect, 8–12 RP on success.
    4. Appeal to Faith (Brother Geralt)
        ○ Religion or Insight/DC 13–16: If successful, 5–8 RP as he persuades the devout.
    5. Barter Supplies (Farmer Joen)
        ○ Insight or Persuasion/DC 14–17: Promises of future protection earn 5–7 RP.
    • Blacksmith for arrow making (How Many Arrowheads Can I Forge in a Day?)
        
        
 Random Encounters
    • Bandit Ambush – Defeating them impresses locals (+5 RP).
    • Sick Villagers – Providing aid or healing yields a small RP bonus.
    • Faerie Trickery – Resolve a minor fae prank for a modest reward (+2 RP).
Climax: The Final Dilemma
    • Lady Kira offers her personal guard (an extra 10 RP) but only if the PCs leave fewer defenders in Elkwood, risking bandit raids.
    • Choosing to protect Elkwood means fewer total recruits but gains Lady Kira’s long-term loyalty.
    End of B1.5: The party either succeeds in mustering a sizable force—gaining a reputation as reliable leaders—or scrapes by with a smaller contingent, foreshadowing challenges ahead.

B1.6 – Sent to Drelev: A Perilous Journey
Overview
Having proven themselves in Elkwood, the PCs are dispatched to Drelev with whatever recruits they’ve gathered. This journey cements their transition from hopeful villagers to soldiers of the duchy, exposing them to both new allies and imminent threats.
Travel Highlights
    1. First Day – Forest & Refugees
        ○ Frozen woodland paths, uneasy quiet.
        ○ Possible encounter with desperate refugees fleeing “Grey Hunger” zones.
        ○ PCs might gain insight into how dire the plague has become.
    2. Second Day – Treacherous Terrain
        ○ Cliffs and icy river crossings.
        ○ A bandit skirmish or evidence of enemy scouts from Emyrs.
        ○ Survival or Perception/DC 14: Spot safe routes or hidden dangers.
    3. Third Day – Approaching Drelev
        ○ Tensions rise as they near a fortified settlement bracing for war.
        ○ Patrols question the PCs, suspicious of outsiders during a crisis.
        ○ Arriving at Castle Drelev reveals a camp of uneasy soldiers.
Arrival & Assignment
    • The party is processed through strict checkpoints, heightening the sense of martial law.
    • Captain Voss (or a similar officer) reviews their recruitment paperwork.
    • Promotion: Recognizing their initiative, he assigns them to guard the western curtain wall—a vital but vulnerable section of Drelev’s defenses.
Themes & Challenges
    • Resource Scarcity: Limited rations and frigid conditions test the party’s resolve.
    • Military Hierarchy: The party must follow orders or risk punishment.
    • Building Alliances: Diplomacy with other units, dealing with tension in the ranks.
    End of B1.6: The PCs stand watch on Drelev’s western wall, nerves on edge, fully aware that war with Emyrs looms. The siege will soon test everything they’ve learned.

Conclusion of B1
In B1: Starting the Conflict, the players begin as humble villagers of Okton, learn of the Duke’s glory and swift downfall, grapple with the spreading “Grey Hunger,” and step into leadership roles they never imagined. By the time they arrive at Drelev, they’ve gone from idealistic hunters to fledgling soldiers on the brink of a larger war—poised for the next stage of the campaign.
