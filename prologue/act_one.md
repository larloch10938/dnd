ulating eyes and a disheveled appearance. He carries several scrolls and a ledger.]
[Enter GENERAL TOK-NAK, a sturdy dwarven warrior with a braided beard adorned with small ruby clasps. His ceremonial armour bears the marks of many battles, and he carries a warhammer that serves as both weapon and symbol of his office.]
[Next is CAPTAIN SET DASTAN, a tall, watchful human with the scarred face of a career soldier. His uniform is immaculate, and his hand rests habitually on the hilt of his sword.]
[Enter HIGH PRIEST BORIS, a stern-looking cleric of Helm in formal blue and silver ecclesiastical robes. His posture is rigid, his gaze cold and assessing as he surveys the room.]
[YHULIA VELAN, Master of the Mint, enters last. She is an elegant woman in her fifties, wearing robes of deep gold with subtle embroidery of coins and scales, symbols of Waukeen. She carries a ledger bound in fine leather.]
DUKE LOHE: (seating himself at the head of the table) My lords, my lady, I thank you for attending this final council bh cold formality) The Cathedral of the Unsleeping Eye is ready to receive its first king, Your Grace. Helm's blessing awaits you. (with subtle emphasis) I have personally overseen every detail of the sacred rites.
LORD ROBERTS: Helm's blessing and all the other Celestials, you mean, High Master?
BORIS: (impatiently) Exactly!
DUKE LOHE: And the regalia?
BORIS: (with a thin smile) The crown, the scepter, and most importantly, the shield rest upon the altar, awaiting tomorrow's ceremony. The crown in particular is... quite heavy. (watching Lohe carefully) I wonder if Your Grace has the strength to bear such a weight.
DUKE LOHE: (sharply) My strength is sufficient, High Priest. (He rises, moving towards the map on the table, though he grips the edge for support when he thinks no one is looking)
YHULIA: (smoothly interjecting) The treasury has allocated funds for both the ceremony and the subsequent festivities, Your Grace. The new royal mint has produced commemorative coins bearing your likeness. (She produces a oice, Your Grace. It honours tradition while embracing your vision for the future.
LORD ROBERTS: (making notes) It shall be proclaimed as the royal arms tomorrow.
DUKE LOHE: (moving to another scroll) Now, to the matter of succession. (He pauses, suppressing another cough) Prince Noah must be formally acknowledged as heir.
BORIS: (with calculated concern) The prince is young, Your Grace. Barely twenty years old. Should anything... unfortunate... befall you, a regency might be necessary.
TOK-NAK: (bluntly) The lad has a good heart but knows nothing of war or leadership.
CAPTAIN DASTAN: (loyally) He has made progress in his martial training, Your Grace. Given time—
DUKE LOHE: (cutting him off) Time is precisely what we must ensure he has. (His voice strengthens with determination) Noah will be named heir tomorrow, without ambiguity. If a regency were necessary—which it will not be—Lord Roberts would serve as regent, assisted by a council comprised of all of you.
[Boris's expression sours momentarily beforou would prefer to appoint a delegate?
BORIS: (interjecting) The Order of Helm should have separate representation from the church itself. The Order commands a significant military force.
CAPTAIN DASTAN: (cautiously) The Order's loyalty has been... questionable in the past.
DUKE LOHE: (firmly) The Order will have a seat, but their representative will answer to you, Boris. I will not have divided religious authority in my council.
BORIS: (with barely concealed displeasure) As Your Grace wishes.
YHULIA: (consulting her ledger) There is also the matter of the vacant Barony of Jambis and the regency of Varnhold. Both situations create... instability in our political structure.
LORD ROBERTS: (nodding) Appointments must be made soon, but perhaps not on the day of your coronation, Your Grace. Such decisions require careful consideration.
DUKE LOHE: (nodding) Agreed, but we have no time to waste.
(He rises, swaying slightly before catching himself)
[The Duke has a sudden coughing fit, turning away from the table. He th the spymaster. The Duchess of the West questions Noah's readiness.
DUKE LOHE: (with determination) Then we must accelerate our plans. The coronation is not a mere ceremony—it is armour. Once I am king, certain... arrangements can be made that a mere duke could not guarantee.
DASTAN: (nodding) I understand, Your Grace. And I shall see it is done.
DUKE LOHE: (placing a hand on Dastan's shoulder) I know you will. You have never failed me. (He moves towards the door, then stops) And Captain... watch over my son when I am gone. He will need your wisdom more than I ever have.
DASTAN: (with genuine emotion) To my last breath, Your Grace.
[DUKE LOHE exits, walking with careful dignity despite his weakness.] [DASTAN remains, looking thoughtfully at the map.]
DASTAN: (softly to himself) The game becomes more complex, but the prize... (He looks towards the ducal throne) The prize remains the same.
