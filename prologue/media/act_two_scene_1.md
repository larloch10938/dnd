this is a depiction for a dungeon and dragon historical campaign in the drawing style of Todd Lockwood in the Forgotten Realms. The scene is the Grand Procession through Allania. Banners and tapestries in the vibrant colors of the Ruby (red and gold) hang from buildings. Flowers adorn windowsills. The air is filled with distant music, the murmur of the crowd, and occasional cheers.
