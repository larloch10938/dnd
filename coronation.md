THE CORONATION OF THE RUBY
SECTION TWO: THE CORONATION

SCENE A: THE PRE-CEREMONY VIGIL AND PREPARATION
SETTING: A private, austere chapel within the ducal palace. Simple stone walls, a single stained-glass window depicting Helm's vigilant eye. A plain wooden prayer stool and a simple cot are present. The air is cool and still. The magnificent Shield of Lohe rests on a velvet cushion on a small altar. Stripped of his ducal robes, DUKE LOHE WOOD stands before the Shield, clad only in a simple linen under-robe. His breathing is shallow, and a fine tremor runs through his hands.
(The scene opens with DUKE LOHE kneeling with difficulty on the prayer stool. He spent the night praying, only Ser Dastan on his side. It’s now the sunrise. He wears a simple, unadorned linen under-robe. His breathing is shallow, and a slight tremor runs through his hands as he clasps them. DASTAN stands beside him, a steadying presence.)
DUKE LOHE: (Voice slightly hoarse, a low murmur) "Spirits of this land, ancestors of my line… ifthing." He attempts to rise, but his knee buckles slightly. Dastan’s arm is there instantly, supporting him.

(LORD ROBERTS, GENERAL TOK-NAK, and DUCHESS ANDRAS enter quietly. They are dressed in more formal, yet still practical, attire suitable for the pre-ceremony. They see for the first time the extent of the gray pestilence, which is now covering a good amount of Lohe’s body. They are scared but hey conceal it.)
ROBERTS
Your Grace. The hour approaches. Are you prepared?
DUKE LOHE
(He straightens his posture with visible effort, adopting a more regal bearing)
As prepared as one can ever be, Roberts, for the embrace of destiny and... (He trails off, glancing towards the Shield again).
TOK-NAK
(His voice is a low rumble)
The men are ready, Your Grace. The people gather. anticipation hums in the air.
ANDRAS
(Approaching Lohe gently)
Your Grace, I can see your body is fighting, but I fear it’s a battle it will not win.
DUKE LOHE
(He subtly evades her touch, forcing another smile)
Not now, Andras. Not yet)
Loyal hearts... and circling vultures. Boris watches, ever ready to exploit weakness. The Duchess of the West... she has her own ambitions for the succession.
TOK-NAK
(Gripping the hilt of his warhammer)
Let them come. My hammer remembers oaths of fealty.
DUKE LOHE
(Nods, a genuine warmth in his gaze towards the dwarf and Dastan)
And I am grateful for such loyalty. But a king's strength must be his own. (He pushes himself away from Dastan, standing alone, though his hands still tremble slightly.) This illness... it has stolen time. Time I needed to ensure Noah's path was clear. (He looks at the Shield again, then back at his council) The coronation... it is not merely ceremony. It is armor. Once I am King, I can make... arrangements...  Safeguards. For Noah. For the realm.
ROBERTS
(Stepping forward, holding a simple, clean tunic)
Then let us don that armor, Your Grace. The people await their King.
(Lohe nods. DASTAN steps forward to assist Lohe with the tunic. Lohe struggles slightly with the movement, need occasional cheer.
(SOUND of trumpets fanfaring.)
(The GRAND PROCESSION begins to move through the streets. First march various city officials, guild representatives bearing their banners, and minor clergy. Then come ranks of soldiers, followed by the PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS, arrayed according to their station.)
(AURIEL L'AULICO, the Royal Herald, a figure in resplendent livery, rides near the front, his voice clear and resonant.)
AURIEL L'AULICO
Hear ye, hear ye! The Procession of the Coronation of His Grace, Lohe Wood, Duke of the Ruby, soon to be crowned King of Chasir-Asak! Make way for your liege!
(Behind the initial ranks, the key figures are arrayed. LORD ROBERTS and YHULIA VELAN ride together or walk near each other, their eyes scanning the faces in the crowd.)
ROBERTS
(Low, to Yhulia)
Observe their reactions, my dear. Are they cheering for the Duke, or merely the spectacle?
YHULIA
(Subtly adjusting a fold in her rich robe)
The cheers are loud enough. But note the hands that remain in pockets, the eyes tside street as Yhulia and Roberts pass. Their faces are etched with hardship, their eyes alight with a desperate hope. They press against the line of City Guards.)
COMMONER 1 (Voice hoarse, reaching out a trembling hand towards Yhulia) Lady Yhulia! The Celesti! A blessing for my child! She burns with fever!
COMMONER 2 (An older woman, her face thin and pale, trying to push past a guard) Mercy, good Lady! Just a touch! Master Akiros! A prayer from the herald of Tempus!
COMMONER 3 (Calling out, his voice cracking) The Celesti walk among us! Share your grace! We are desperate!
(The City Guards, initially caught off guard by the suddenness and fervour of the small crowd, grunt and shove back, trying to maintain their line. It's not a riot, but a messy, emotional surge that briefly disrupts the dignified pace of the procession. Some onlookers gasp, others murmur nervously.)
YHULIA (Her expression shifts to one of deep compassion. She instinctively makes a small gesture as if to reach out, her voice gentle but carrs, his tone firm but not unkind) Your pleas are heard, but this is not the time. Order must prevail.
(The combined presence and decisive actions of Tok-Nak and Dastan, along with the reinforced guards, manage to push the desperate commoners back into the alleyway, their cries softening to mournful pleas and prayers. YHULIA watches them go, her face etched with sorrow and concern. She offer a silent prayer.)
(DUKE LOHE, who had watched the disruption with a flicker of unease on his pale face, straightens again. He gives a curt, almost imperceptible nod towards Dastan, a silent acknowledgement of the situation being handled, before steeling his expression back into regal composure.)
(Meanwhile, BORIS, the High Priest of Helm, has observed the entire exchange from his position among the senior clergy. His lips thin into a severe line, and a shadow of displeasure crosses his face as he notes the crowd’s appeal to Yhulia and Akiros, bypassing the ordained clergy of the city's primary faith.)
BORIS (To a nearby jBREACH IN THE CITY WALLS, where the owlbear once attacked. The stone is newer here, a stark reminder of past danger and sacrifice. A palpable tension hangs in the air. SET DASTAN, riding his warhorse, is particularly vigilant here, his eyes sweeping over the rooftops and the crowd. GENERAL TOK-NAK, walking alongside Dastan, gives a low grunt, his hand instinctively resting on the head of his warhammer.)
(As the DUKE approaches this point, a brief, solemn halt is called. Two guards bear the Shield of Lohe forward, displaying it for a moment before the repaired wall. The sunlight catches the rubies embedded within it.)
AURIEL L'AULICO
Behold, the Shield of Lohe! A symbol of the strength that defended these walls, and the sacrifice that secured this city! May the new King bear this shield with the same courage and vigilance!
DUKE LOHE: "Before this mended scar, we remember the fury of the wild and the vigilance required to protect our homes! We honour the fallen and the defenders!"
(A ripple of renewed cheering d excited crowds to something more solemn as they approach the sacred edifice. The smells change from flowers and damp earth to the faint scent of incense.)
(ROBERTS and YHULIA observe the crowd's reaction, noting the ebb and flow of enthusiasm, the clusters of onlookers who seem less engaged.)
ROBERTS
(Low, to Yhulia)
The westerners are here in force. And Andrisha makes a show of loyalty, but her gaze is too keen.
YHULIA
(Her eyes sharp and calculating)
And Edelroth's men... restless. They seek leverage.
(Boris, meanwhile, continues his subtle assessment, his eyes like a hawk's, identifying key figures in the crowd, remembering faces and positions.)
BORIS
(To his cleric)
That merchant, near the North Gate... I know his face. A supporter of the Duchess of the West. Curious he would brave the heart of the city today.
(The procession reaches the GRAND CATHEDRAL. Waiting just outside the entrance is a representative from Elkwood, a forester or hunter, holding a magnificent set of STAG ANTLERS draped with sheavesine power, Waukeen's benevolent gaze, and the legendary victory of the Diaconi over the owlbear. The High Altar is draped in rich cloth of deep red and silver. A temporary throne, simple but dignified, is placed near the altar.
(At Rise)
(SOUND of the outdoor crowd and music diminishes, replaced by the echoing acoustics of the Cathedral. A CHOIR begins singing a solemn, majestic hymn.)
(The Procession enters the Cathedral. The order is reversed somewhat, with the highest-ranking officials and nobles entering first. DUKE LOHE enters near the end, still flanked by DASTAN and TOK-NAK. His step is slower now, the effort of the procession weighing heavily on him.)
(BORIS, standing near the High Altar with other SENIOR CLERGY, watches Lohe's entry, his hands clasped before him.)
BORIS
(In a low voice to a cleric beside him)
See how he leans? The whispers are not without merit.
(Lohe is guided towards the chair of estate near the altar. He sinks into it with a visible sag of his shoulders before quickly straightenin but delivered with a measured cadence that subtly emphasizes the 'burdens' and the need for 'constitution'.)
(As Boris speaks, Lohe closes his eyes for a brief moment, a look of weariness etched on his face. Andras watches him, her brow furrowed with concern. Roberts and Yhulia exchange a quick, knowing glance.)
(Upon the conclusion of the prayer, Boris gestures towards the altar.)
BORIS
Let the sacred rites commence. Let the chosen one be prepared for the touch of the divine.
(The Choir's hymn swells again. Attendants come forward to assist Lohe.)
(Lohe, looking weary, kneels on a velvet cushion before the altar. Assisting clerics help to loosen the upper part of his simple under-robe, exposing his chest.)
(Boris steps forward, the silver vial held aloft. The vial is ancient, chased with symbols of the eight divinites watching over the kingdom. The oil inside is thick, perhaps with a strong, slightly acrid scent mingling with traditional holy oils.)
BORIS
(His voice is solemn, but his eyes hold a cold calcue looks directly into Lohe's eyes for a long moment)... and reveal the true strength that lies within. Be blessed and consecrated King over this realm, by the authority granted unto the Church of Helm!
(Lohe closes his eyes, a bead of sweat trickling down his temple. He takes a slow, shaky breath. Andras bites her lip, her hands clasped tightly. Roberts watches Boris intently, a flicker of unease in his eyes.)
BORIS
(To the assisting clerics)
Prepare him for the vestments.
(Assisting clerics gently wipe away excess oil and prepare Lohe for the next stage. Lohe remains kneeling for a moment, his head bowed, seemingly gathering his strength.)
(Lohe, having been assisted to his feet, stands as attendants begin the process of vesting him in the ceremonial robes. A simple linen tunic first, then a heavier dalmatic embroidered with symbols of the Ruby, followed by a long, flowing mantle of deep crimson, lined with ermine.)
(This process is physically demanding for Lohe. He sways slightly. Andras watches, her healinol of your duty to administer justice and defend the realm against all foes!
(He presents the Shield to Lohe, who takes it for a brief moment before it is placed nearby.)
(BORIS stands before Lohe, holding the CROWN – the twisted diadem of rubies and iron. It is heavy, ornate, a potent symbol. He then passes it to Lord ROBERTS)
ROBERTS
(His voice slow, deliberate)
Receive this Crown, the sign of your sovereignty, placed upon your head by the authority of the divine. May it rest heavy, a constant reminder of your burdens... and your power.
(He raises the Crown. Andras visibly stiffens, her eyes wide with apprehension. Roberts' gaze is fixed on the Crown, then on Lohe. There is a brief, pregnant pause before Roberts lowers the Crown onto Lohe's head. Lohe closes his eyes for a moment, bracing himself. The sheer weight of the iron and rubies seems to press down on him, forcing him to sag slightly before he straightens his shoulders with a renewed effort.)
(Tok-Nak stands ready, with the ceremonial SWORD OF STAs subtly adjusts the Tome's position, perhaps making it slightly awkward for Lohe to rest his hand naturally, adding to his physical discomfort.)
(Lohe places his hand on the ancient, heavy binding of the Tome. The symbol of Helm is deeply carved into the cover.)
BORIS (CONT'D)
Repeat after me, and swear by your life and soul, by the divine grace bestowed upon you, and by the future of this realm.
(Boris recites the lines of the oath, phrase by phrase, with Lohe repeating after him. Lohe's voice starts strong, but shows signs of strain.)
BORIS
I, Lohe, shall govern the people of Chasir-Asak...
KING LOHE
(Voice slightly hoarse)
I, Lohe, shall govern the people of Chasir-Asak...
BORIS
...according to their ancient rights and customs...
KING LOHE
...according to their ancient rights and customs...
(Lohe emphasizes "ancient rights," glancing subtly at the assembled nobles. A few nods of approval are visible, but others remain impassive.)
BORIS
...I shall dispense justice with fairness and mercy...
KING LOHE
...I on his throne. The floor before the throne is clear.
(Representatives of the various estates – the clergy, followed by the nobility – approach the throne in order of precedence to swear fealty to the newly crowned King. The atmosphere is a mix of formal ritual and underlying political tension.)
(The highest-ranking clergy kneel first, led by BORIS.)
BORIS
(Voice formal)
We, the servants of Helm and the Holy Church, do swear fealty to you, our liege and King, saving our duty to the divine. We shall uphold your just rule and pray for your prosperity.
(Other clergy repeat the oath. Lohe nods, offering a faint smile.)
(Next, the Nobles approach. They kneel one by one, placing their hands between the King's, a gesture of submission.)
(DUCHESS ANDRAS kneels, her expression one of deep respect and loyalty.)
ANDRAS
My liege, I, Andras, Duchess of the Ruby, do swear my fealty and the fealty of my lands and people. May your reign be long and just.
(Lohe clasps her hands warmly, a genuine affection in his eyes.)
KINeps away.)
(The REGENT OF VARNHOLD, ANDRISHA, approaches. She kneels and swears her fealty, but wears a noticeable SAPPHIRE PENDANT – the colours of Duke Batholemus of the East, Roberts' father.)
ANDRISHA
Your Majesty, I, Andrisha, Regent of Varnhold, swear fealty to you and your crown. May peace and prosperity reign.
(As she rises, she exchanges a brief, almost imperceptible glance with Roberts and Yhulia. Yhulia gives a subtle, almost hidden nod.)
(Other nobles offer their homage, some with genuine enthusiasm, others with formal correctness, a few with thinly veiled ambition or resentment in their eyes. Lohe receives each one, his strength visibly waning, though he maintains his regal composure.)
(DASTAN and TOK-NAK do not swear homage in this formal sense, their loyalty being understood through their offices and proximity to the King.)
(Boris watches each noble closely, noting their demeanour, the speed of their kneeling, the sincerity of their oaths. Roberts and Yhulia continue to observe the political from Dastan and Tok-Nak?)
(BORIS'S jaw tightens, his eyes darting amongst the nobles. He seems almost disappointed by the lack of challenge.)
(TOK-NAK'S hand moves instinctively to the hilt of his warhammer, his eyes scanning the assembly with a fierce, protective glare – a clear, silent threat to anyone contemplating breaking the peace.)
(DASTAN stands rigid, his gaze fixed and watchful, ready to act at the slightest sign of trouble.)
(ROBERTS and YHULIA watch the crowd intently, their expressions neutral, but their eyes missing nothing. They are looking for hesitation, for fear, for hidden defiance.)
(ANDRAS watches Lohe, her concern evident. Lohe himself sits perfectly still, his face pale but resolute.)
(The silence stretches, tense and heavy, for several long moments. No voice is raised in challenge.)
(AURIEL l'Aulico scans the assembly one last time, then turns back towards the throne.)
AURIEL L'AULICO (CONT'D)
There being no challenge...
(He raises his voice, turning to the assembly.)
AURIEL L'AULICOmperceptible smile of satisfaction. Tok-Nak brings his warhammer down once on the stone floor with a resonant thud, a sound of solid approval. Dastan relaxes slightly, though his vigilance remains.)
(The cries of "Long Live the King!" fill the Cathedral as Section Two concludes.)
