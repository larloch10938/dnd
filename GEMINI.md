I want to write a war themed dungeons and dragon adventure. I want the setting to be low fantasy, with a strong historical grounding. The place where this is happening are the Forgotten Realms Border Kingdoms. I really liked the book Agincourt from Bernard Cornwell and I want to use a lot of the experiences in the book as a base for my role play. 

The module should be loosely based to chapter 5 of the Kingmaker campaign in pathfinder War of the River Kings. I want to add more complexity to it, playing it with two companies, one of high level charters and one of low level charters. The structure is highlighted in the structure.md file. Your task is to help me write each section.

The place where all of this is happening is called the Duchy of Chasir-Asak, which means the Ruby Duchy in draconic language. The capital of the Duchy is Allania, and other important cities are Varnhold to the east, Elkwood in the North West, Tazelford in the South West and Bes-Inix in the centre, slightly north of Allania which is the centre too. The main bordering kingdoms are Blacksaddle to the North and Emrys to the West. The whole adventure should focus on the start and end of the conflict with Emrys, a kingdom next to the Duchy. You can find more information about the Duchy in the kingdom.md file.
