I want to write a dungeons and dragons session that looks like a play. It's the prologue of my campaign. The characters are: 
    - The Duke, Lohe Wood, who is getting elevated to king
    - The chancellor, Lord Roberts, who is the mastermind of the duchy/kingdom
    - The old dwarven general Tok-Nak
    - The captain of the guards, Set Dastan 
    - Andras, the morning star, the most important Duchess and a healer
    - Auriel l'Aulico, the royal herald

I, as DM, will also play the characters of the high priest (a cold knight and cleric of Helm called Boris) and the master of the coin (a female cleric of Waukeen called Yhulia Velan). The Duke is suffering from illness, but he is concealing it. There should be subtle hints to this. The high priest is very ambitious and cannot be trusted, but he does his best to conceal it. The master of the coin is in a relationship with Lord Roberts.

The structure of the play should be the following:

    1. The explanation of the politics behind closed doors
    2. The coronation ceremony
    3. The party afterwards

The style should be a blend of Shakespearean court drama and historical medieval coronation rituals (e.g., Plantagenet England, Holy Roman Empire).

There are a few files already written that I will use as a base for the play. They are:
- **C:\Users\AS\Google Drive\Avventure\Gemini\corontation.gdoc** which contains the coronation ceremony
- **C:\Users\AS\Google Drive\Avventure\Gemini\politics.gdoc** which contains the politics behind closed doors
- **C:\Users\AS\Google Drive\Avventure\Gemini\kingdom.gdoc** which contains additional information about the kingdom and its characters
