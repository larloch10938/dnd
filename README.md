# War Themed Dungeons and Dragons Adventure

This repository contains the outline and content for a low-fantasy, historically-grounded Dungeons and Dragons adventure set in the Forgotten Realms Border Kingdoms. The adventure is inspired by Bernard Cornwell's 'Agincourt' and loosely based on Chapter 5 of the Kingmaker campaign in Pathfinder, 'War of the River Kings'.

## Setting

The adventure takes place in the Duchy of Chasir-Asak (the Ruby Duchy), with its capital in Allania. Other key cities include Varnhold, Elkwood, Tazelford, and Bes-Inix. The main bordering kingdoms are Blacksaddle (North) and Emrys (West). The narrative focuses on the conflict with Emrys.

## Structure

The adventure is designed to be played with two companies: one of high-level characters and one of low-level characters. The structure is detailed in `structure.md`.

## Chapters

Each chapter will detail a part of the adventure, building upon the narrative of the war with Emrys.
