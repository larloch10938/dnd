# Kingdom of Chasir-Asak  
*"The Ruby Kingdom"* (Draconic: *Chasir-Asak*)  

## Power Structure  
### Duchies and Vassals  
- **Duchy of the East** (Varnhold): Eastern stronghold; currently under regency due to the **vacant title of Jambis** and unresolved leadership issues.  
- **Duchy of the West** (March of Drelev): Cursed region; governed by **Queen Julia's sister**.  
- **Duchy of the Ruby** (Allania): Capital region.  
- **Independent County**: **Tok Nak Durgak** (Gul Nak), ruled by **[[Baron Tok Nak Durgak]]**, also known as the "Blind Baron," who answers directly to the crown. Surrounded by fertile fields, it serves as a critical trade hub for dwarves.  

### Family Ties & Political Intrigue  
- **Baron Guglielmo Edelroth** (Ruby) is the father of **Count Aethan Edelroth** (West).  
- **Queen Julia’s sister** governs the West, creating tension between the duchies.  
- **Power Struggles**: Vacant titles (e.g., Jambis, Varnhold’s regency) threaten stability.  
- **Grand Master of Helm**: **Boris Manobianca** (of Torrerossa) commands the influential **Order of the Skulls of Varnhold** (now dissolved but still whispered of in underworld circles).  

### Government  
- **The Diaconi** (the Deacons): The ruling council advising the king, originally a group of adventurers who founded Allania.  
  - The council now shares power with mercantile companies, whose influence grew during the **Long Peace (1377–1391 DR)**.  
  - Council members include: **Lady Kisandra Numesti** (Bes Inix), **Ser Nicholas Okerra**, **Aethan Edelroth**, **Andras Morgarion** (Duchess of the Ruby), **Avexi Abernati**, **Johd Kaven**, **Lady Jane Sane**, and **Ser Boris Manobianca**.

  - Rich in iron and gold mines; population of 5,000+.

It was founded by a man named Ileno, who built a church there in memory of his wife, Izra, who died of despair after the Varnhold Vanishing. It is rumored that the paladin Stepsay (Seltyel) and his faithful followers of Helm are hiding in this village. Some refer to the place as "El-Izra," a name that carries connotations of both sanctity and fanaticism, reminiscent of the heretic El Dayan.
